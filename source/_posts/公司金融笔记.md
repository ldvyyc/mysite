## Intro

Profitable（accounting） vs.  Value（NPV，Finance）

* Different Purpose
	* Accounting is looking back to history
		* Not considering risk, which happened already
	* Finance is looking forward to future
		* Have to consider risk
* Costs in Finance
	* In finance, investment costs include not only costs paid in cash, but also the non-cash, such as opportunity cost.
		* Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative forgone
* When the investment income is greater than all of the above costs, we say the investment “creates value

#### Goal of financial management

To maximize the market value of existing owner's equity.

#### Agency Problems

##### agency relationship
Debtors and Shareholders is an agency relationship, shareholders represent debtors.

stockholders and management is an agency relationship, management represent stockholders.

##### ways to solve

* management compensation
	* stock options
	* promotion
* enhance control over the firm
	* internal control, replace bad managers
	* external control, hostile takeover threat
* bankruptcy threat

#### 3 basic financial management decisions

##### investment decision (capital budget)
* trade-off between short-run and mid-run productivity.
* current asset vs. fixed asset
##### financing decision (issuance of securities)
* trade-off between tax-shield and low cost of financial distress
* leverage ratio
##### Operating decision (curr. asset vs. curr. liability)
* net working capital = cur. asset - cur. liability
* NWC is usually positive in healthy firm
* liquid higher, less chance to be in financial distress
* a trade-off between liquidity and long-term potential return
* a trade-off between liquidity and profit

#### Finance markets

* Primary markets
	* The original sale of securities by corporations
	* Cash flows into the firm from investors
	* firms -> underwriting syndicate(承销商, banking groups -> investment banker) -> individual and/or institutional investors
* Secondary markets
	* Once issued, stocks and bonds are bought and sold between investors in secondary markets
	* Exchange market, OTC

## financial statements, taxes, and cash flow

#### Mkt vs Book value
* The balance sheet provides the book value (historical cost) of the assets, liabilities, and equity
* The market value is the price at which the assets, liabilities or equity can actually be bought or sold today
* 对于健康的成长公司，mkt value > book value
* market value更重要，反映当前的cash flows
* 主要的变化在于equity，即股价波动

#### cash flow and accounting income

* To companies, cash flow is more important than profit
* Negative profit doesn’t lead to bankruptcy, as long as there is cash flow 
* Bankruptcy does not mean negative profit. It is simply due to no cash to pay interest

##### mismatch

* GAAP (权责发生制)
* Depreciation 
* Receivable Financial Cash Flow
* Payable
* Deffered

##### Financial cash flow

* To evaluate a project or a firm, we must determine its **Cash Flow From Assets （CFFA）**
* CFFA tells us the cash flow (positive or negative) generaged by the corporation as a legal entity during a period

#### Cash flow from assets （CFFA）

1. Operating cash flow （OCF）
	* earnings before interest and taxes plus depreciation minus taxes
	* the cash flow that results from the firm’s day-to-day activities of producing and selling
	* = EBIT –Tax+ Depreciation    （I/S）
	* = NI + Depreciation + interest
	* Making money
	* See #IncomeStatement
	* "Making Money"
2. Additions to net working capital （$\Delta$ NWC）
	* change in （current assets - current liabilities）
	* = Ending NWC - Beginning NWC
	* "Leave money for operation"
3. Net Capital spending
	* （Acquisitions of fixed assets minus sales of fixed assets）
	* money spent on fixed assets less money received from the sale of fixed assets 
	* =  Ending net fixed assets （B/S）- Beginning net fixed assets （B/S）+ Depreciation （I/S）
	* "Leave some money for fixed assets"
* $CFFA = OCF - \Delta NWC - NCS$

cash多对debtor好，对shareholder坏。
reduce CFFA -> reduce value of the firm

**CF（A） = CF（D） + CF（E）**, right hand side = cash flow to investors in firm
asset = debt + equity

* Cash flow goes to equity holders
	* Dividends plus repurchase of equity minus new equity financing
* Cash flow goes to debtor
	* interest plus retirement of debt minus long-term debt finacing

* 主要看OCF是不是正的，健康的business经常是正的OCF
	* exception：startup company
* CFFA的正负不太重要

## Long-term Financial Planning and Growth


* Payout ratio = Dividends / Net Income

#### Financial Planning Process

* Case 1: Assuming growth is driven by sales
	* Step 1:Forecast sales growth rate g **（g is completely exogenous）** 
	* Step 2: In the case when sales drive assets, everything will grow at the same rate as sales, which leads to a constant **profit margin** 
	* Step 3: Prepare forecast financial statements (pro forma statements), which show 
		* Requirement of fixed assets and net working capital 
		* Financing arrangements (i.e., dividend policy, debt policy)
	* Step 4: Vary assumptions
	* ![case1](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230319162226.png)
	* EFN: external finance needs
* Case 2: Internal growth rate
	* Assuming growth is not driven by sales, instead it is driven by internal retained earnings only, meaning No external financing! 
	* Asset is growing at g with only internal retained earnings 
	* - What is the maximum growth rate that can be achieved?
	* $$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{NI}_{\mathrm{t}}=(1+\mathrm{g}) \times \mathrm{NI}_{\mathrm{t}-1} \\
& \mathrm{RE}_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{NI}_{\mathrm{t}} \times \mathrm{b} \text { Retention Ratio } \\
& \mathrm{EFN}=0 \Rightarrow \Delta \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}-1} \times \mathrm{g}=\mathrm{RE}_{\mathrm{t}} \\
& \text { From (1), (2) and (3), } \\
& A_{\mathrm{t}-1} \times \mathrm{g}=(1+\mathrm{g}) \times \mathrm{NI}_{\mathrm{t}-1} \times \mathrm{b} \\
& \text { Define ROA }=\mathrm{NI}_{\mathrm{t}-1} / \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}-1}, \quad \rightarrow \text { 资产回报率 } \\
& \begin{array}{l}
\text { Internal growth rate } \\
\qquad g=\frac{R O A \times b}{1-R O A \times b}=\frac{1}{1-R O A \times b}-1
\end{array} \\
&
\end{aligned}
$$
* Case 3: Sustainable growth rate
	* Assuming growth is not driven by sales and is not driven by RE either
	* Instead, a firm chooses debt financing to maintain a constant debt-equity ratio
	* In such a case, equity and debt are growing at g to maintain the constant debt-equity ratio
	* $$\frac{E_{t-1}}{A_{t-1}}=\frac{E_t}{A_t}=\frac{E_{t-1}+R E_t}{A_{t-1} \times(1+g)} \quad (1)$$
	* $$R E_t=N I_{t-1} \times(1+g) \times b \quad (2)$$
	* Dividing both sides of equation (1) by $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}-1} / \mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{t}-1}$, we get$$1=\frac{1+\frac{R E_t}{E_{t-1}}}{1+g}=\frac{1+\frac{N I_{t-1} \times(1+g) \times b}{E_{t-1}}}{1+g}$$
	* Define ROE $=\mathrm{NI}_{\mathrm{t}-1} / \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{t}-1}$, (可维持增长率), we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 1+g=1+R O E \times(1+g) \times b=> \\
& g=\frac{R O E \times b}{1-R O E \times b}=\frac{1}{1-R O E \times b}-1
\end{aligned}
$$

* 可持续增长率 $\ge$  内部增长率
	* ROE允许borrow
* 怎样提高可持续增长率？
	* 提高b
	* 提高ROE/ROA
		* Increase operating efficiency (Increase profit margin or decrease operating cost) 
		* Increase target debt-equity ratio

## Time Value of Money

**It is only possible to compare values at the same point in time!**

#### Interest rate (Discount rate)

* If we assume cash flows are risk-free, then we use risk-free interest rate, such as bank deposit rate. 
* When cash flows are risky, we should use interest rates with risk premium 
* Later, discuss the determinants of risk premium.

#### Future value (FV) and Present Value (PV)

* The future value is the amount of money an investment will grow to over some period of time at some given interest rate. 
* For one period: FV=PV(1+r) where
	* FV = Future value 
	* PV = Present value 
	* r = (market) interest rate for one period 
	* Note: One period could be one day, one month, one year, etc.
* The present value is the current value of future cash flows discounted at the appropriate discount rate.
* FV = PV × (1 + r) 
* thus PV = FV / (1 + r)

#### Present Value and Discounting
* For two or more periods:
	* PV = FV / (1 + r)t
* r is often called the discount rate. 
* 1/(1+r)t is the present value interest factor (PVIF) or called the **discount factor**. 
* the “value” of something
	* Generally referred to the present value unless specifically indicate that we want the future value

#### Some useful terminology
* "in period x" means at the end of the xth period
	* for example:
	* “in year 5” means the end of the fifth year
	* “how much will you have in year 2” means how much will you have at the end of the second year
* Unless otherwise stated, the rate of return and discount rate given in problems is assumed to be an annual rate
	* In practice, interest rates are typically stated on a per annum basis 
	* Adjustments must be made for fractional year

## Discounted Cash Flow Valuation

Relatively easy, so just put part of the content in this note

* Annuity – a finite series of equal payments that occur at regular intervals
	* If the first payment occurs at the end of the period, it is called an ordinary annuity (普通年⾦) 
	* If the first payment occurs at the beginning of the period, it is is called an annuity due (期初年⾦)
	* Unless stated otherwise, all annuities are assumed to be ordinary annuities
* Perpetuity (永续年⾦) – an infinite series of equal payments
	* PV = C/r
	* If the payment grow at g each period, then
		* PV = C / (r-g)
* $\begin{aligned} & \text { PV of annuity }=C \times\left[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r(1+r)^T}\right]=\frac{C\left[1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}\right]}{r} \\ & F V \text { of annuity }=C\left[\frac{(1+r)^T-1}{r}\right]\end{aligned}$

#### APR and EAR

* APR:
	* annual interest rate is always quoted assuming no compounding within one year 
* EAR:
	* Effective Annual Rate (EAR) is the actual rate paid (or received) after accounting for compounding that occurs during a year.

$$\mathrm{EAR}=\left[1+\frac{\mathrm{APR}}{\mathrm{m}}\right]^m-1$$
- $\mathrm{m}$ is number of compounding per year or compounding frequency.
- $\mathrm{EAR}=\mathrm{APR}$ when $\mathrm{m}=1$, annually compounding
- What occurs as the frequency of compounding rises to infinity?
$$
E A R=\operatorname{lim}_{m \rightarrow \infty}\left(\left(1+\frac{k}{m}\right)^m\right)-1=e^k-1
$$
- Example:
	- The effective annual rate that's equivalent to an annual percentage rate of $18 \%$ $$=\mathrm{e}^{0.18}-1=19.72 \%$$
	- (almost the same value with daily compounding)

#### Basic types of Loans

* Pure discount loans
	* No periodic interest payment
	* sold at discount
* Interest-only loans
	* periodic payments are interest only
* Amortized loans
	* periodic payments include both interest and some principal
* Discount interest loans
	* 提前支付interest

## Interest Rate and Bond Valuation

#### Bond

* Definition of a bond
	* issuer borrows $ and makes specified pmts to bondholder on set dates
* Characteristics
	* Face value, princeple, or par value
	* Coupon rate (different from market Interest rate)： Zero coupon bond 
	* Maturity
	* Bond Indenture (债券契约)
* Corporation bonds
	* regular
	* callable(可赎回), 
	* puttable(可卖回), 
	* convertible(可转换)

* Price and interest rates have a reverse relationship

* Bonds selling at discount
	* Price < face value
	* Coupon rate < market rate
* Bonds selling at premium
	* Price > face value
	* Coupon rate > market rate

![price_to_maturity.png](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230319172755.png)

Invoice price = flat price + accrued interest
dirty price = clean price + accrued interest

#### Yield to Maturity

* assumptions about YTM
	* hold the bond to maturity.
	* re-invest the coupon on the same bond.
	* Assuming market interest level maintains unchanged.

* Can't compare two investment decision by comparing YTM, because high risk high return.
	* only ok when have exactly same characteristics

Holding period yield and holding period return.

#### Term structure

The yield curve displays the relationship between spot rates and maturities
![yield_curve.png](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230319185633.png)

* Different shapes of the term structure
	* Upward Sloping
		* Long-term spot rates > Short– term spot rates 
	* Downward Sloping
		* Long-term spot rates  < Short–term spot rates
	* Flat
		* Long-term spot rates = Short-term spot rates
	* Humped
		* Intermediate term spot rates > Short and Long-term spot rates
* The Yield Curve is Time Varying
* Measuring the Term Structure (Yield Curve)
	* Method I: Computing from zero-coupon bond
	* Bondprice $=\frac{\text { Par }}{\left(1+r_n\right)^n}$
	* Method II: When zero-coupon bond is not available, the bootstrapping method!
		* Use bonds of progressively longer maturities, starting from T-bills

#### Determinants of Bond Yield

* Level of Market interest rate 
* Default risk
	* quality of the issuer, security, and seniority 
	* risk structure
		* Describes the relationship between YTM and credit risk level
		* Credit risk: the risk that the issuer of a bond may default (i.e., will be unable to make timely principal and/or interest payments)
	* Bond ratings
		* measures the prob. of default
		* Internationally recognized rating companies:
			* Moody's
			* Standard Poor's
			* Fitch Ratings
		* BBB-及以上属于investment，以下属于speculatino（投机）
	* Default risk and security
		* **Collateral** is a general term that frequently means securities (i.e., bonds and stocks) that are pledged as security for payment of debt.
		* **Mortgage securities** are secured by a mortgage on the real property (i.e., land or buildings) of the borrower.
		* Secured vs. Unsecured
			* 破产时优先还secured的人的钱
* Interest rate
	* Only one risk from market: interest risk
	* The risk that arises for bond owners from fluctuating (market) interest rate is called interest rate risk.
	* How much interest rate risk a bond has depends on how sensitive its price is to interest rate changes.
	* **Duration**
		* $\color{red}{讲的不太清楚，投资学再看一下}$
		* 期限的加权平均（mac duration）
			* 平均多长时间把cash收回来
		* 1. Duration is equal to maturity for zero coupon bonds 
		  2. Duration is shorter than maturity for coupon bonds
		  3. Holding other factors constant, duration is lower when the yield to maturity is higher
		  4. Holding other factors constant, duration is lower when the coupon rate is higher

		* ![image.png](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230319193048.png)
* Real rate, Nominal Rates, and Inflation 
	* The nominal interest rate is the percentage change in the number of dollars
		* Financial rates, such as interest rates offered by banks and other financial institutions, and the rates for discounting cash flows, are almost always quoted in nominal terms.
	* The real interest rate is the percentage change in terms of purchasing power.
	* The inflation rate is then defined based on the growth rate of consumer price index (CPI)
	*  **the Fisher Effect**
		* (1+R) = (1+r) × (1+h)
		* R 名义利率，r实际利率，h通货膨胀率
		* $R \approx r + h$
* Taxability 
* Embedded Options 
	* Callable bond (可赎回债券)，卖的价格低
		* Grants the issuer the right (but not the obligation) to retire the bond before the scheduled maturity date. 
		* The call price will usually exceed the face value.
	* Putable bond (可售回债券)，卖的价格高
		* Grants the bondholder the right (but not the obligation) to sell the bond back to the issuers on designated dates.
	* Convertible bond (可转换债券)，卖的价格高
		* Gives the bondholder the right (but not the obligation) to exchange the bond into a specified number of shares of common stock during a certain period.
* Liquidity Risk (Lack of Marketability)
	* Investors demand a liquidity premium on illiquid bonds.额外流动性费用
	* The upward sloping yield curve is an illustration of investors’ preference for liqudity
	* 流动性好的市场，asset价格更高

## Stock Valuation

* A share of common stock is more difficult to value in practice than a bond
	* There are no promised cash flows.
		* Cash flows are unknown in advance. 
	* The life of the investment is infinite.
		* Common stock has no maturity 
	* The rate of return that investors requires is unobservable.


* What can we do?
	* Discounted CF
		* FCFF(free cash flows of the firm)
			* 
	* Dividend growth model 
		* Stock price = PV(Dividends) + PV(Expected Price)
		* $P_0=(D_1+P_1)/(1+r)$
		* r is the required rate of return for stocks (cost of equity)
		* continue, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{o}}=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{D_t}{(1+\mathrm{r})^t}$
		* stock price does not depend on how long an investor keep the stock
		* 假设了公司不破产
		* **Some models**
			* Constant dividend, $P_0=\frac{D}{r}$
			* Constant growth dividend, $P_0=\frac{D_1}{r-g}=\frac{D_0(1+g)}{r-g}$
				* this is dividend growth model
				* r > g
			* Nonconstant growth
		* Where does g come from?
			* assume a constant ROE.
				* Net Income = Return on Equity * Equity
				* Growth of dividend = Growth of net income = Growth of equity
				* **g = ROE * b**, b is retained ratio
				* $E_1$ = earnings per share to be paid for the current year = Net income/Number of shares
				* $D_1$ = **Dividend per share**=$E_1*(1-b)$
		* **ROE决定了公司价值**
			* 当ROE>r时，随着b上升，$P_0$上升，是一家好公司
			* 当ROE=r时，随着b上升，$P_0$不变
			* 当ROE<r时，随着b上升，$P_0$下降，是一家不好的公司
				* 股东想把钱拿回来去找别的项目获取更高的return
	* “Quick and dirty” valuation – Multiples
		* Price-Earning Ratio 市盈率
			* price per share / earnings per share
			* trailing P/E: $P_0/EPS_0$ (EPS over last 12 months)
			* Forward P/E: $P_0/EPS_1$ (EPS over coming 12 months)
			* 通常倾向于Forward P/E
			* **Value = Earnings * PE**
		* Price-Sales ratio
		* Prick-Book ratio


#### cost of equity: $R_E$

* Approach 1: CAPM
	* Advan:
		* explicitly adjust for systematic risk
		* applicable to all companies
	* Limit:
		* estimate risk premium
		* estimate beta
		* need to rely on historical data
* Approach 2: Dividend Growth Model
	* Advan
		* easy to use
	* Disad
		* 必须当前在pay dividend
		* 对于dividend增速不合理的无效
		* 对预期增长率极度敏感
		* 假定当前价格合理
		* 没有显式考虑risk
