## L2: Basics

### basic terms

* Bid price: the price at which a dealer is willing to purchase
* Ask/offer price: the price at which a dealer is willing to sell 
* One basis point = 0.01 percentage point; that is 100 bps = 1%
* Tick price-one tick usually equals 1/32 of a dollar, e.g., 98.22+,103.05++
	* old market convention
	* 103.55 = 103 + 5/32 + 1/64 + 1/128
* Yield to maturity （YTM）, or yield, is the discount rate at which the present value of all future cash flows equals bond price
	* **IRR asumption**
		* all future cash flow will be reinvested in the same yield
		* project will not obsolete before it is done

### Interest rate

* Simple interest
	* interest is calculated based on the outstanding principal amount only.
	* Simple interest applies to repurchase agreements (repos) and other money market instruments.
	* $$FV = PV(1+r*\frac{t}{365})$$
		* r 是年化利率

* Compound interest
	* interest is calculated based on the sum of outstanding principal amount and accumulated interests, that is, interest on interest.
	* In general, m-ly compound for n years
	* $$FV=PV(1+\frac{R}{m})^{n\times m}$$
	* 对于连续复利
	* $$FV=PV exp^{rt}$$
		* 计算方便
	* 转换：
		* $$(1+\frac{R}{m})^{n\times m}=exp^{rt}\text{  , thus  } r=m*ln(1+\frac{R}{m})$$

### Pricing basic securities

* Perpetuity
	* $$P_{perpetuity}=\frac{C}{r}$$
* A security that pays A (dollars) per period for n periods is known as annuity, e.g., a mortgage.
	* If the first payment occurs one period from now, it is called ordinary annuity; 
		* $$P_{annuity}=\frac{A}{r}[1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}]$$
	* if the first payment happens now, it is called annuity due.

#### Zero-coupon bond
* Treasury bills （T-bills） are zero-coupon instruments, but their maturities are no more than one year.
* How to obtain zero-coupon bonds of longer maturities? 
	* In the U.S., STRIPS （Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities） are the registered interest and principal components of a coupon bond （fixed-rate T-bond or T-note） in the Federal Reserve Banks' book-entry system.
		* A 30-year Treasury bond can be separated into 61 STRIPS: 60 semiannual coupons plus a single face value payment.
		* The one original security is now 61 separate new securities with unique Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures （CUSIPs）.
* STRIPS are effectively zero-coupon bonds （zeroes）.


### Pricing rule in fix-income securities

* No arbitrage

* An arbitrage opportunity is a feasible trading strategy involving two or more securities with either of the following characteristics:
	1. It does not cost anything at initiation but generates a sure positive profit by a certain date in the future;
	2. It generates a positive profit at initiation but has a sure nonnegative payoff by a certain date in the future.
* The no-arbitrage condition requires that no arbitrage opportunities exist.
* The law of one price establishes that securities with identical payoffs should have the same price.
	* **not expected, but exact same payoff!!**
* 




---

## L3: Repo and monetary policy interest rate system

### Repurchase Agreement

* Repurchase agreement (repo) is a contract under which the seller sells a security on the initiation date with an deal to repurchase it at a higher price on a specified later date.
* Repo is an important short-term financing tool in financial markets.

#### Conventional repo

**Purpose of repo is to borrow money**

* Initial transaction: X give treasury note to Y and get cash
* Closing transaction: X get teasury note back and give Y cash and interest
* **used to borrow short-term money**
* essentially a secured loan for X with the security as collateral
* X retains the cashflow rights
* ![repo transaction](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230327224231.png)

##### 例子

* 6月10日，X买入T-bond，从Y那里借了值当前债券价格的99.5%（Y要保护自己from market and credit risks），Y take a haircut
* 6月13日，X卖出T-bond，将3天的accrued interest连同本金还给Y，自己赚剩下的钱
	* interest rate 按照 simple interest 计算
* 由于长期金融工具的interest高，因此从short-term借钱去投long-term产品，可以赚钱
	* riding the yield curve
	* 这种操作面临的风险是interest rate risk和liquidity risk（债券可能卖不出去）

#### Reverse repo

**Purpose of reverse repo is to borrow security using cash as collateral**

* Initial transaction: X give cash to Y in order to get bonds
* Closing transaction: X give back bond to Y and get cash and accrued interest back
* **a monetary policy tool, in order to inject liquidity to the market**

##### repo specialness

* Special （Collateral） repo: 只能还借走的那一个bond
* General （Collateral） repo: 一类债券都可以，比如只要是两年期 on the run 的T-note都可以用来还
* 通常来说，special repo rate 非常低，因为 I desperately need it.
* 交易策略: lend out special asset, use the cash to buy general asset.


#### Repos in China

##### 两种repo形式
* Pledged repo 质押式
	* a type of short-term financing business where bonds are used by both trading parties as a pledge of rights
	* borrower 向 lender 借钱，约定按照未来确定日期的 specified repo rate 还钱
	* 与 conventional repo 类似，但是在这种情况下 bonds 被冻结了，lender 不能动这些债券
	* 造成了 treasury bond 流动性下降
* Outright repo 买断式
	* positive repo party sells bonds to the reverse repo party, agreeing that the positive repo party buys from the reverse repo party an equal number of same-type bonds at a predefined price in the future.
	* 会有交易成本
	* 只占中国的百分之十左右
	* 相当于把bond进行了交割，bond 产生的interest 归 reverse repo party

##### 交易场所

* Interbank market
	* 符合条件的银行与金融机构，无个人投资者
	* 双边交易
	* 11种maturities：1日，7日，14日，21日，1月，2月，3月，4月，6月，9月，1年
	* 两种repo都在这里交易
* Exchanges （SSE，SZSE）
	* 无商业银行
	* 只有质押式回购
	* 双边交易
		* bond pledge-style agreement repo （customized）债券质押式协议回购；bond universal pledge-style repo（standardized）
	* 三边交易
		* 第三方用来提高交易效率，减小风险

##### Applications of reverse repo in open market operation
 
* Open market Operation, OMO, 指中央银行在公开市场上购买/售卖证券
	* for liquidity injection 注入流动性
		* PBOC purchases collateral eligible debt instruments from the interbank market participants and sells it back to the market seven days later
	* As short-term policy rate
		* PBOC lowered the interest rate on liquidity tool by 10 basis point to 2.15% from 2.25%, as it restarted its 14-day offerings for the first time since late January.
	* Key maturities: 7day, 14day, 28day


### China's policy rate system

![policy rate system](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328121213.png)

[[Drawing 2023-03-28 11.29.18.excalidraw]]

* **DR007**
	* 7 days repurchase （repo）rate for depository institutions
	* short term market benchmark rate
* **MLF**, Medium-term Lending Facility, 中期借贷利率
	* lending facility that PBoC lends to financial institutions through scheduled （monthly） auctions
		* Participants: policy and commercial banks
		* high quality collateral, such Treasury bonds and central bank bills, are required
		* Maturity: 3 months, 6 months, 1 year
* **Prime rate** （best interest rate）
	* 银行给信用高的用户的最佳借贷利率
* **Loan Prime rate**, LPR
	* quoted by 18 banks based on OMO operations rates （mainly MLF）
	* calculated by National Interbank Funding Center 银行同业拆借中心
	* **benchmark for bank lending**
	* 每月20号上午9点15公布

* **Interest rate corridor**
	* the range within which the operating target of the monetary policy--a short-term interest rate -- moves around the policy rate announced by the central bank
![利率走廊](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328151448.png)


* **Standing lending facility**, SLF
	* lends on a bilateral and on-demand basis rather than in the open market through scheduled auctions
	* 非公开市场
	* 例如，商业银行找央行单独说，非常需要钱
		* 通常出现了流动性的问题
		* act as a last resort
	* maturities: O/N （overnight）, 7 day, 1 month
* **Interest rate on reserve balances（IORB）**
	* rate of interest that central bank pays on reserve balances maintained by depository institutions
	* rate is set by central bank
	* important monetary policy tool
	* 例如：客户向我存款100元，商业银行向央行存11元（目前的要求是11%）
		* 防止商业银行破产
* **Interest rate on excess reserve（IOER）**
	* 超过11%的部分存入央行的利率
	* 也是货币政策工具
	* 提高IOER给商业银行激励去把更多钱存到央行，减少了money supply

## L4: Treasury Bond

### Treasury bond market in China

#### Treasury bond
* In China, Treasury bond are the liabilities of the central government issued by the Ministry of Finance.
* considered risk-free
* 两种：
	* book-entry Treasury bond 记账式
		* 只issue给institution和很少一部分个人投资者
		* 在二级市场可交易
		* coupon-bearing bond的maturity都长于1年（最长50年）
		* discount bond的maturity有 28, 63, 91, 182, 273 days
	* savings treasury bond 储蓄式
		* 电子或凭据形式，issue给个人投资者

	* issue 储蓄式 via underwriters
	* issue targeted treasury bond to targeted social security instutitions and insurance companies （如社保基金）
		* 少见
* 二级市场
	* enchanges: SSE, SZSE
	* OTC: interbank market and bank counter

##### member of underwriting syndicate

* 15个A级银行，40个B级银行/债券公司
* 每两年更新一次


### Issuance of Book-Entry Treasury Bonds

#### treasury tender offer

* 包括competitive 和 noncompetitive bids
	* competitive同时报价价格与要求的数量
	* noncompetitive只报价数量，作为price taker。也叫 additional bids
	* noncompetitive bids通常只对A级银行允许，并且需要是10年期以下的coupon-bearing bonds
		* quantity restrictions applied
* bid subject 是价格或利率
	* 对于coupon-bearing bond，bid 利率
	* 对于discount bond 和 reopening issue of coupon-bearing bond，bid价格

#### 标位 bid positions 与 限制 bid restriction

* Each issue notice stipulates the unit of change in bid position.
* The unit tells the minimal difference in price/interest rate between two adjacent bid positions.
* In an interest rate auction, the unit of change in the bid position is 1 basis point.
* In a price auction, the unit of change in the bid position is stipulated in the notice.
	* The unit typically increases with bond maturity;
	* For example, 0.001 yuan for the 2023 28-day （20 billion yuan） and 63-day （20 billion yuan） discount bonds （Issues No.1 and No.2）;
	* For example, 0.002 yuan for the 2023 91-day （40 billion yuan） discount bonds （Issue No.4）.

* 限制
	* 最高最低价差不能超过要求
	* too wild will be DQ

#### bidding and underwriting amount requirements

* maximum bidding amount: 35% of the auction（competitive bidding）amount for a Class-A memebr; 25% for class-B member
* minimum bidding amount: 4% for Class-A member, 1.5% for Class-B member.
* minimum underwriting amount: 1% for Class-A member, 0.2% for Class-B member.

#### determine winning bid

* 在满足条件的报价中，从最高价/最低利息开始直到市场出清或者所有报价都accounted for
* the lower interest, the better for MoF
* **bid 一家银行在一段时间内可以多次提交**
* 最高的winning interest rate 叫做 stop-out yield （SOY）
	* 同时报价了winning interest rate，按照报价的数量按比例分配，round up to 0.01 billion yuan, 将余下的给到先报价的公司


![timeline](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328154743.png)

#### Pricing mechanism

* Multiple price/discriminatory auctions（American Auction）
	* Each winning bid receives the interest rate it expresses to receive.
* Uniform price auctions（Dutch Aution）
	* All winning bids receive the same highest interest rate at which the market clears.
	* 对于报价 < stop-out yield的，全部按照stop-out yield购买
* Modified multiple price auctions
	* 首先对所有winning bids 按数量对报的利率进行加权，算出利率
	* Winning bids for interest rates equal to or below the coupon rate pay the par price
		* Encouagement to bid for lower
		* 报价小于这个平均数的，按照100元购买，按照平均利率
	* Winning bids for interest rates higher than the coupon rate pay discount prices, calculated with the interest rates expressed to receive, respectively.
		* 按照平均利率作为coupon rate，按照自己报的利率作为利率，将bond折价。用这个价格购买bond，按照自己报价的利率
	* **interest rate更高的付更低的款**
		* 公平

**注意，这里面报价的利率实际上是coupon rate**

#### Secondary Market Market-Making Support Operation
* Ministry of Finance （MoF） uses buy-and-sell tools to support market-making in the interbank market.
	* When market supply exceeds demand, MoF buys Treasury bonds from market makers, called the buy operation
	* When demand exceeds supply, MoF sells Treasury bonds to market makers, called the sell operation
* Participating institutions are simultaneously Class-A members of the Treasury underwriting syndicate（15个） and market makers in the interbank market（11个）.

### US treasury securities

most important market in the world

#### Classes of Treasury securities

* Marketable
	* Can be traded in the secondary market 
	* Sold at auction, rates set via competitive bidding
	* e.g., Bills, Notes, Bonds, TIPS, and FRNs
		* Zero coupon bonds are created by market participants and are not issued directly by Treasury
		* 是通过金融工具构造出来的
* Non-Marketable
	* Can not be traded and can be sold only to Treasury
	* Sold to investors by subscription, rates set administratively
	* e.g., Savings Bonds, State and Local Government Series

#### Marketable Treasury securities

![timeline](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328161040.png)

#### Treasury Auction

* 只有 primary dealer 拥有直接进行 auction 的权利
* pricing mechanism：uniform price auction
	* 1999年从 American auction 改成了 Dutch auction


### When-Issued trading

* When-issued （WI） is a transaction or trade in securities that are not yet issued, on the understanding that the trade will be settled once the securities are issued.
* When-issued trading occurs between the announcement date and the issue date. 
	* time concide with primary market
* Dealers and investors can take significant long or short positions that do not require financing.
* WI trading constitutes a special kind of forward market for non-existent securities.
	* a special forward market
* Active WI markets exist for US Treasury securities and sometimes Freddie Mac securities issued by auction, e.g., reference bills.

#### Benefits of WI trading

* **information discovery**
* 对于 primary dealer，可以了解到客户希望的interest rate和quantity。并且由于签了contract，避免了非对称信息，必须进行交易。

#### Downside of WI

* Short squeeze
	* **squeezing the market** means a dealer/market participant corners most or all available supply in security to engineer an artificial price rise;
	* may refer specifically to the futures or repo markets when the supply of loanable or deliverable securities is reduced by such cornering activity.
* Repo specialness
	* refers to repo transactions in specific securities, where only the special securities can be delivered back to close out the transaction.
	* substitution of similar collateral, such as other securities of the same issuer, are not accepted for transaction closure.

![short sqeeze](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328162758.png)
[[Drawing 2023-03-28 11.53.48.excalidraw]]

#### take advantages of the specialness

* Enter into a repo: sell your security and agree to repurchase it later.
* Since the security is scarce, you will obtain a high price relative to the "forward" price. That means you can borrow at a specially low repo rate.
* Invest the cash in a standard "non-special" investment and earn the difference between the prevailing market rate and the special repo rate.
* There exists an incentive to create such "specialness," e.g., theSalomon Brothers scandal in 1991.

## L5: Duration, PVBP, Convexity

* Interest rate risk refers to the adverse price movement of a bond resulting from the change in market interest rate. For bond investors, it is typically the risk that the interest rate will rise.
* **inverse convex relationship between price and yield**
* How to measure interest rate risk?
	* Duration
	* Convexity

### Duration

* Duration of a debt security is its discounted-cash-flow-weighted time to receipt of all promised cash flows divided by its price.
* Consider a coupon bond price expressed in continuous compounding,$P=\sum_{i=1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}$, duration is expressed as
	* $$D=\frac{\sum_{i-1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}\times t_i}{P}$$
* **Loosely speaking: average time to receive all the cash flows**
* $\color{red}{duration 没有单位！！}$

* Duration is the price elasticity of interest rate, which measures a fixed income security's exposure to interest rate risk.
* $$\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}=-PD$$
* thus,$$D=-\frac{\frac{\partial P}{P}}{\partial y}\approx -\frac{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}{\Delta y}$$

#### Definition

* Macaulay duration:
	* $$D^{Macaulay}=-\frac{dP/P}{d(1+y)/(1+y)}=-\frac{dP/P}{dy}(1+y)$$
	* 离散情况
* modified duration
	* $$MD=-\frac{dP/P}{dy}$$
	* 连续情况

#### Properties of duration
* A zero-coupon bond's duration equals its maturity, implying that the zero-coupon bond is the most interest-rate-elastic instrument for a given maturity.
* A coupon bond's duration is less than its maturity.
	* Duration increases with maturity.
	* Duration decreases with coupon rate and yield to maturity.
	* Duration is time-varying.
* As a linear approximation of the price-yield relationship, duration may not work well for significant shifts in the term structure.
* Duration works only for parallel shifts in the term structure and may fail miserably if the term structure tilts while shifting parallelly.


#### Other terms

* **Term structure** of interest rates refers to the relationship between spots rates （yields to maturity of default-free zero-coupon bonds） and their maturities.
* **Yield curve** is the plot of yield to maturity against time-to-maturity or a risk measure （e.g., duration）.
	* Shapes: normal （upward）, inverted （downward）, humped
	* Components: the level factor, the slope factor, the curvature factor


### PVBP

* PVBP=PBP=DV01
* The **price value of a basis point （PVBP） or dollar value of 01 （DV01）** is the change in a bond's price due to a change in the interest rate.
* PVBP is typically expressed as the change in value of a $1 million （par value） position in reaction to a change in the yield of one basis point, that is, $\frac{1}{100}$% .
* **是dollar measure**
* $\partial P/\partial y$ tells us how much a bond price will change when y increases by one, that is, 10,000 basis points.

* $$\Delta_P=\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\Delta_y=\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\frac{1}{10000}$$
* $$PVBP=\Delta_P\times 10000=DP$$

### Trading and Hedging strategy

#### Hedging interest rate risk with Treasury futures contract
* Example
* Suppose we have a portfolio whose market value （P） is $7,500,000. We would like to use Treasury Futures contracts to hedge the interest rate risk. The face value of one Treasury futures contract is $100,000, and its price is $96. The durations of the portfolio and Treasury futures contract （ $D_P$ and $D_F$ ） are 6 and 5, respectively. How many Treasury futures contract （N） should we trade?
	* the objective function: 久期加权为0
	* $$D_P+D_F\times F_C\times N=0$$
	* solve for this equation, N = -94
	* We should short 94 such treasury futures contracts.

##### Treasury futures
* A special kind of forward contract
* buy treasury-futures is equivalent to holding the bond, which means I will take on the risk.
* In the contrary, short the T-futures will get rid of the interest risk.
* 因为约定了远期之后，在这期间相当于我拥有bond，获得bond的coupon，获得了risk。

#### Hedging interest rate risk with interest rate swap

* Example
* A firm holds bonds of $100,000,000 （market value, A）, whose duration （ $D_A$ ） is 5. At the same time, the firm owes a debt （L） of $90,000,000, whose duration （ $D_L$ ） is 3. The firm wants to hedge its interest rate risk using interest rate swap. The notional principal of an interest rate swap contract is $100,000, and the durations of its fixed-rate leg and floating-rate leg are （ $D_{FX}$ and $D_{FL}$ ） 4.5 and 0.6, respectively. How many interest rate swap contracts the firm should enter into （K）?
	* the objective function: duration neutral
	* $$[D_A\times A-D_L\times L]+[(D_{FX}-D_{FL})\times K]=0$$
	* solve for the equation, K = -575
	* firm should enter into 575 contracts, paying fixed rate and receive floating rate.
* **Less costly than trading a bond**

#### Spread Trading

* Spread trading bets on changing slope of the term structure.
* We construct a trading strategy that pays off if the yield curve steepens or flattens sufficiently but is insensitive to parallel shifts in the term structure.
* There are two scenarios where the yield curve can steepen:
	* short rates increase less than long rates （in a bearish market）熊市
	* short rates fall more than long rates （in a bullish market）牛市
* To gain exposure to the yield curve slope, we need to trade （at least）two bonds of different maturities.
	* Short the long bond and long the short bond

##### Example

* Positions: short a 6-year bond with 8% coupon and long a 2-year bond with 5% coupon
* Suppose the current term structure is flat at 5%, we compute
* $$B_{short}=99.76 \quad B_{long}=114.52\quad D_{short}=1.95 \quad D_{long}=5.07$$
* Suppose we long 100 short bonds; how many long bonds do we need to short in establishing duration neutrality?
* $$\frac{n_{\text {short }} B_{\text {short }}}{n_{\text {short }} B_{\text {short }}+n_{\text {long }} B_{\text {long }}} D_{\text {short }}+\frac{n_{\text {long }} B_{\text {long }}}{n_{\text {short }} B_{\text {short }}+n_{\text {long }} B_{\text {long }}} D_{\text {long }}=0$$
* The result shows that we need to short 33.57 long bonds.
* This duration-neutral portfolio is worth $6,132, and its value will increase if the yield curve slope rises substantially.

##### 实际中

* long the short and short the long
	* 买入短期，卖空长期
	* 通常需要repo/ reverse repo
* The position will be neutral to parallel shifts in the yield curve, that is, duration-neutral
	* $$n_{short}\times PVBP_{short}=n_{long}\times PVBP_{long}$$
* 实际情况中，即使确实存在spread，这种交易也不怎么挣钱
* **主要原因是bid-ask spread ！！！**
* 其他可能因素：haircut，special repo rate，repo rate


### Convexity

* Convexity is the change in the slope of the price-yield curve for a slight change in the yield.
* ![Convexity](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328202823.png)

* A bond's convexity is measured as the second derivative of the bonds price to its yield
	* 泰勒展开
	* $$\color{red}{dP=\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\partial^2P}{2\partial y^2}(dy)^2}$$
		* 第一项是PVBP，后项系数 $\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}$ 是dollar convexity.
	* 两边同除P
		* $$\color{red}{\frac{dP}{P}=\frac{\frac{\partial P}{P}}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}}{2P}(dy)^2}$$
		* 第一项系数是Duration，后项系数$\frac{\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}}{P}$ 是relative convexity.

* **Dollar Convexity** is 
	* $$$Conv=\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}=\sum_{i=1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}(t_i)^2$$
* **Relative Convexity** is
	* $$RConv=\frac{$Conv}{P}=\frac{\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}}{P}$$
	* 对于zero coupon bond, relative convexity = $t^2$
		* 把前面的系数消掉了

#### Positive and negative convexity

* Security exhibits positive convexity when its price rises more due to a downward movement in yield than its price falling due to an equal upward movement in yield.
	* ![Positive Convexity](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328212144.png)

* Bullet securities typically exhibit positive convexity.
* Callable bonds usually exhibit negative convexity at lower yields. The price of a callable bond might drop as the likelihood that the bond will be called increases, and the shape of a callable bond's curve of price to yield is concave or negatively convex.
	* $$P_{callable}=P_{regular}-V_{\text{call option}}$$
	* 当利率下降时，等式右边两项同时上升，要看两者的上升速度与绝对值
	* 当上升绝对值V更高时，会出现concave
	* ![callable bond](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328212641.png)

* Most mortgage securities exhibit negative convexity due to the mortgage borrower's incentive to refinance at a lower rate when market yields decline.
	* 与callable bond很像

#### Property of Convexity

* Positive convexity is desirable! Convexity bias explains the curvature of the yield curve.
	* 由于convexity是二阶导的系数，当convexity是正的时候这一项永远是正的，因此 dP 会是正的，这是好事
	* 考虑term structure，zero coupon bond 的 convexity 是 $t^2$, 当t增大时convexity增大，由于convexity是好事，所以人们愿意花更多的钱去购买这个bond（随着时间增大），因此bond的interest rate就会越来越低，造成向下的曲率
		* ![convexity bias](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328213617.png)

* Bonds with greater convexity tend to gain more in price when yields fall than they lose when yields rise.
* The more convex a bond price is, the more valuable the bond is. 
* If interest rates are volatile, this asymmetric response of price to yield is more desirable.
