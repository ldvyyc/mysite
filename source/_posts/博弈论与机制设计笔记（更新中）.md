## L2: Static Games of Complete Information

### Normal-form games

* Static: one shot, simultaneous move
* complete information: each player’s payoff function is common knowledge among all players. 

##### Normal-form representation
* the players （参与者） in the game;
* the strategies （策略） available to each player;
* the payoff（收益/效用） received by each player for each combination of strategies that could be chosen by the players.

* $\color{red}{\textbf{complete: 是不是common knowledge}}$
* $\color{red}{\textbf{perfect: 每次decision对方是否知道}}$


##### Normal-form Defination
The normal-form （标准式） （also called strategic-form） representation of an n-player game speciies the players' strategy sets/spaces $S_1$ , . . . , $S_n$ and their $\color{red}{\text{payoff functions}}$ u1, . . . , un. We denote this game by
* $$G=<S_1,S_2,...S_n,u_1,...u_n>$$
* Can also represent by bi-matrix form.

### Concept of strategy

#### Some notations:

* $$s=(s_1,s_2,...,s_{i-1},s_i,s_{i+1},...,s_n)$$
* $$s_{-i}=(s_1,s_2,...,s_{i-1},s_{i+1},...,s_n)$$
* $$S=S_1\times S_2 \times ...\times S_{i-1}\times S_{i}\times S_{i+1}\times...\times S_n$$
* $$S_{-i}=S_1\times S_2 \times ...\times S_{i-1}\times S_{i+1}\times...\times S_n$$
* $$\color{red}{s=(s_i,s_{-i})}$$

#### 策略

* Best response:
	* 在其他人选定的情况下对我最有利的情况
	* $$\max_{s_i\in S_i} u_i(s_i,s_{-i})$$
	* denoted by $$R_i(s_{-i})$$
* Strictly dominated stratey
	* 在所有情况下都不如另一个策略，另一个策略不一定是NE
	* A rational player will never choose a strictly dominated strategy.
* Strictly dominant strategy
	* 在所有情况下都严格比其他所有策略好
	* If a strictly dominant strategy exists, then it must be unique. 
	* A rational player will always choose a strictly dominant strategy, if any.
* Weakly dominant strategy
	* 在所有情况下都大于等于其他所有策略

##### 关系

* A strictly dominated strategy can never be a best response
* A strictly dominant strategy is always a best response

### IESDS and Nash Equilibrium

#### IESDS

* 不断消去strictly dominated strategy

* main drawbacks
	* A key assumption: rationality of all players is common knowledge.
	* The prediction of IESDS may not be very precise, and sometimes it predicts nothing about the games. 

#### NE

* Defination
	* $$(s_1^*,...,s_n^*)\text{ is a NE if }s_i^*\in R_i(s_{-i}),i=1,2,...,n$$
	* Equivalently, $$u_i(s_i^*,s_{-i}^*)=\max_{s_i\in S_i}u_i(s_i,s_{-i}^*)$$
* Each player’s strategy must be a best response, given other players’ equilibrium strategies.
* No single player wants to deviate unilaterally 
	* strategically stable or self-enforcing.

##### Issues on NE

* A Nash equilibrium needs not to be Pareto optimal （帕累托最优）
* More generally, Nash equilibrium does not rule out the possibility that a subset of players can deviate jointly in a way that makes every player in the subset better off.
* The Nash equilibrium **implicitly assumes that players know that each player is to play the equilibrium strategy.** Given this knowledge, no player wants to deviate.

#### Relationship between IESDS and NE

* NE can survive IESDS
	* $${\text{Nash Equilibria}\subset\text{subset of IESDS}}$$
* Nash equilibrium is a stronger solution concept than IESDS. 
* Nash equilibrium does not require that rationality is common knowledge.
* 在有限的情况，IESDS如果消到只剩下一个，那一定是NE

### Applications

#### Cournot Duopoly

* 题目
	* Suppose two firms （1 and 2） produce a homogeneous good, and compete in quantities.
	* Let $q_i$ be the quantity produced by firm i, where i = 1 , 2. 
	* The aggregate quantity of the good is denoted by $Q = q_1 + q_2$. The inverse demand （反需求函数） of the good is $P(Q)=a-Q$ 
	* The cost function of firm i is $C_i(q_i) = cq_i$
* 将题目化成 normal-form game
* 找best response 的交点
* 结论：
* $$(q_1^*,q_2^*)=(\frac{1}{3}(a-c),\frac{1}{3}(a-c))$$

#### Bertrand Model of Duopoly

* 计算过程类似 cournot

### Mixed strategies

#### Definition
* In a normal-form game $G=\left\langle S_1, \ldots, S_n ; u_1, \ldots, u_n\right\rangle$, suppose $S_i=\{s_{i1}, ..., s_{iK_i}\}$
	- Each strategy $s_{i k} \in S_i$ is a pure strategy (纯策略) for player
	- A mixed strategy (混合策略) for player $i$ is a probability distribution $p_i=\left(p_{i 1}, \ldots, p_{i K_i}\right)$, for $k=1, \ldots, K_i$, where $p_{i 1}+\cdots+p_{i K_i}=1$ and $p_{i k} \geq 0$.
- Note that there are only $K_i$ pure strategies for player $i$, but infinitely many mixed strategies.

#### Expected payoff

- If player 1 thinks that player 2 will play a mixed strategy $p_2=\left(p_{21}, \ldots, p_{2 K}\right)$, then player 1's expected payoff （期望效用） of playing a pure strategy $s_{1 j}$ is
- $$v_1\left(s_{1 j}, p_2\right)=\sum_{k=1}^K p_{2 k} u_1\left(s_{1 j}, s_{2 k}\right) .$$
- Player 1's expected payoff （期望效用） of playing a mixed strategy $p_1=\left(p_{11}, \ldots, p_{1 J}\right)$ is
- $$\begin{aligned}
v_1\left(p_1, p_2\right) & =\sum_{j=1}^J p_{1 j} \sum_{k=1}^K p_{2 k} u_1\left(s_{1 j}, s_{2 k}\right) \\
& =\sum_{j=1}^J \sum_{k=1}^K p_{1 j} p_{2 k} u_1\left(s_{1 j}, s_{2 k}\right)
\end{aligned}$$
* **A mixed strategy $p_1 = (p_{11} , . . . , p_{1j})$ is a best response （最优应对） to $p_2$ if**
	* $$v_1(p_1,p_2)\geq v_1(p_1^\prime,p_2)$$

#### Mixed strategy NE

##### Definition
* In a normal-form game $G=\left\langle S_1, \ldots, S_n ; u_1, \ldots, u_n\right\rangle$, the mixed strategy profile $\left(p_1^*, \ldots, p_n^*\right)$ is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium if each player's mixed strategy is a best response to the other players' mixed strategies in terms of expected payoff, i.e.,
* $$v_(p_i^*, p_{-i}^*)\geq v_i(p_i, p_{-i}^*)$$
* for every $p_i$ over $S_i$, and for all $i=1, \ldots, n$.

* 求解：
	* **mixed strategy 必须每个分量都是indifferent，每个选项的预期收益是相同的**

##### Applications

* ![battle of sexes solution](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230403211452.png)

##### proposition

* The pure strategies played with a positive probability in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium survive IESDS.
* A pure strategy is a strictly dominated strategy （dominated by a mixed strategy） if and only if it is never a best response （to mixed strategies）.
	* 考虑有mixed strategy情况下
	* 充要条件
	* 即如果有某些action的组合比该action的收益严格高，那么该action就不可能是best response。


#### 存在性定理

* 定理：
	* In the n-player normal-form game $G = ⟨S_1 , . . . , S_n; u_1, . . . , u_n⟩$, if n is finite and $S_i$ is finite for every i, then there exists at least one Nash equilibrium, possibly involving mixed strategies.
* The conditions are suicient but not necessary conditions for the existence of a Nash equilibrium. 
	* 充分不必要条件
* Recall that in both Cournot and Betrand competition models, Nash equilibrium exists but the strategy space is infinite.

## L3: Dynamic Games of Complete Information

### Intro

* dynamic games: sequential choice or repeated play
* Complete Information:  each player’s payoff function is common knowledge among all players 

* **center issue is credibility.**

* Use  extensive-form （扩展式） representation for dynamic games. 
* Draw game trees.

### Games of Perfect Information

![example of dynamic games of complete and perfect information](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230316092735.png)

Player 2 choose after he knows what player 1 choose.

If its imperfect Information, we draw a dotted line between 2 and 2 in the tree above.

**Note that**
* $A_2$ may depend on the action a1, i.e., $A_2(a_1)$.
* Some action $a_1$ may even end the game, so that $A_2(a_1)$ is an empty set （i.e., no choice of player 2）.
* The action $a_1$ is perfectly observed by player 2.

In the game of the farmer and the snake:
![农夫与蛇](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230316093517.png)

##### Some key features
* the moves occur in sequence;
* all previous moves are observed before the next move ischosen
* the players’ payoffs from each combination of moves are common knowledge.

#### Backwards Induction

* In the second stage, player 2 observes what player 1 choose and choose action to solving $$\max \limits_{a_2\in A_2}\quad u_2(a_1, a_2)$$
* Assume this optimization problem has a unique solution, denoted by $R_2(a_1)$.
	* This is player 2's best response to player 1's action $a_1$
* In the first stage, knowing player 2’s best response, player 1’s problem become$$\max \limits_{a_1\in A_1}\quad u_1(a_1, R_2(a_1))$$
* Assume it also has a unique solution, denoted by $a_1^*$.
* We call $(a_1, R_2(a_1^*))$ the backwards-induction outcome (逆向归纳的结果) of the game
* In the backwards-induction outcome, $a_1^*$ is determined by maximizing $u_1 (a_1 , R_2(a_1))$, and $a_2^* = R_2(a_1^*)$. 
* However, $a_1^*$ may not maximize $u_1(a_1, a_2^*)$.

#### Stackelberg Model of Duopoly


Consider a dominant firm moving first and a follower moving second.
* The game is as follows:
	* Firm 1 choose quantity $q_1 \ge 0$
		* Firm 2 observes $q_1$ and then chooses a quantity $q_2 \ge 0$.
	* The payoff of firm i is the profit $$\pi_i\left(q_1, q_2\right)=q_i[P(Q)-c]$$
	* where $Q=q_1+q_2$ and
$$
P(Q)= \begin{cases}a-Q, & \text { if } Q<a \\\\ 0, & \text { if } Q \geq a\end{cases}
$$


##### Now solve this game.
* First, find the best response function $R_2 (q_1)$ for firm 2, i.e.for any given $q_1$, find $q_2$ that solves $$\max _{q_2 \geq 0} \pi_2\left(q_1, q_2\right)$$where
$$\pi_2\left(q_1, q_2\right)= \begin{cases}q_2\left(a-q_1-q_2-c\right), & \text { if } q_1+q_2<a ; \\\\ -c q_2, & \text { if } q_1+q_2 \geq a .\end{cases}$$ 
* Then we have
$$
R_2\left(q_1\right)= \begin{cases}\frac{a-c-q_1}{2}, & \text { if } q_1<a-c \\\\ 0, & \text { if } q_1 \geq a-c .\end{cases}
$$
* $R_2(q_1)$ is the same as that in the Cournot model.
* Second, firm 1 knows $R_2 (q_1)$ and solves$$\max \limits_{q_1 \ge 0} \quad \pi_1(q_1, R_2(q_1))$$ where$$\pi_1\left(q_1, R_2\left(q_1\right)\right)= \begin{cases}q_1\left[a-q_1-\frac{a-q_1-c}{2}-c\right], & \text { if } q_1<a-c \\\\ q_1\left[a-q_1-c\right], & \text { if } a-c \leq q_1<a \\\\ -c q_1, & \text { if } q_1 \geq a\end{cases}$$
- Clearly, for $q_1>a-c$, firm 1's profit is always negative.
- Thus we only need to solve
$$
\max _{a-c \geq q_1 \geq 0} q_1\left[a-q_1-\frac{a-q_1-c}{2}-c\right],
$$
which leads to the following first-order condition
$$
a-c-2 q_1=0 .
$$
- The optimal choice of firm 1 is
$$
q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{2}
$$
- The quantity chosen by firm 2 is
$$
q_2^*=R_2\left(q_1^*\right)=\frac{a-c}{4} .
$$
- The market price is
$$
P^*=a-q_1^*-q_2^*=c+\frac{a-c}{4} .
$$
- Firms' profits and the total profit are
$$
\pi_1^*=\frac{(a-c)^2}{8}, \pi_2^*=\frac{(a-c)^2}{16}, \text { and } \Pi^*=\frac{3(a-c)^2}{16}
$$

##### Compare with Cournot Model
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\begin{array}{ccc}
\text {Variable} & \text{Cournot Model} & \text{Stackelberg Model}\\\\
\hline q_1^* & \frac{a-c}{3} & \frac{a-c}{2} \\\\
q_2^* & \frac{a-c}{3} & \frac{a-c}{4} \\\\
\pi_1^* & \frac{(a-c)^2}{9} & \frac{(a-c)^2}{8} \\\\
\pi_2^* & \frac{(a-c)^2}{9} & \frac{(a-c)^2}{16} \\\\
\Pi^* & \frac{2(a-c)^2}{9} & \frac{3(a-c)^2}{16} \\\\
P^* & c+\frac{a-c}{3} & c+\frac{a-c}{4} \\\\
\hline
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

* Note: First-move advantage:
	* 先手有优势，比起同时的情况。


### Games of Imperfect Information

* Consider the following game
	* Players 1 and 2 simultaneously choose actions $a_1$ and $a_2$ from the feasible sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively.
	* Players 3 and 4 observe the outcome of the first stage $(a_1 , a_2)$ and then simultaneously choose actions $a_3$ and $a_4$ from the feasible sets $A_3$ and $A_4$, respectively.
	* Payoffs are $u_i(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. 
* **There are simultaneous moves within each stage.**

##### Solve
* Still, backwards induction.
- For each given $\left(a_1, a_2\right)$, players 3 and 4 try to find the Nash equilibrium in stage 2.
- Assume the second-stage game has a unique Nash equilibrium$(a_3^*(a_1, a_2), a_4^*(a_1, a_2))$$
- Then, player 1 and player 2 play a simultaneous-move game with payoffs$$
u_i(a_1, a_2, a_3^*(a_1, a_2), a_4^*(a_1, a_2)), \text { for } i=1,2$$
- Suppose $(a_1^*, a_2^*)$ is the unique Nash equilibrium of this simultaneous-move game.
- Then$$(a_1^*, a_2^*, a_3^*(a_1^*, a_2^*), a_4^*(a_1^*, a_2^*))$$is the subgame-perfect outcome （子博恋精炼结果） of the two-stage game.

##### Example: Bank Run

* payoff in date 1:
* |          | Withdraw | Don't      |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Withdraw** | 4,4      | 5,3        |
| **Don't**    | 3,5      | next stage |
* payoff in date 2
* |          | Withdraw | Don't      |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Withdraw** | 8,8      | 11,5      |
| **Don't**    | 5,11      | 8,8 |

###### Solve: backwards

* date2, both obtain 8 in nash equilibrium.
* Thus, in date1, they play the following game:
* |          | Withdraw | Don't      |
| -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Withdraw** | 4,4      | 5,3        |
| **Don't**    | 3,5      | 8,8 |

There are two NE.




### Extensive-form Representation

##### Defination

The extensive-form (扩展式) representation of a game specifies:
* the players in the game;
* when each player has the move; *
* what each player can do at each of his or her opportunities to move; *
* what each player knows at each of his or her opportunities to move; *
* the payoffs received by each player for each combination of moves that could be chosen by the players
**the three * part describes strategies of each player in detail.**

use trees for extensive-form representations.
![extensive-form representation](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230316110447.png)

#### Information Set

* Complete and perfect information
	* A dynamic game of complete and perfect information is a game in which the players move in sequence, all previous moves are observed before the next move is chosen, and payoffs are common knowledge. 
	* **Such games can be easily represented by a game tree.**
* Imperfect information
	*  some previous moves are not observed by the player with the current move. 
	* To present this kind of ignorance of previous moves and to describe what each player knows at each of his/her move, we introduce the notion of a player’s information set （信息集）

##### Definition of Information Set

An information set （信息集） for a player is a collection of decision nodes satisfying:
* The player needs to move at every node in the information set.
* When the play of the game reaches a node in the information set, the player with the move does not know which node in the set has （or has not） been reached.
	*  implies that the player must have the same set of feasible actions at each decision node in an information set; Otherwise the player could infer from the set of actions available that some nodes had or had not been reached.
* **Any two nodes from different information sets of a player can be distinguished from each other.**

##### Application of Information Set

* A game is:
	* of perfect information （完美信息） if every information set is a singleton;
	* of imperfect information （不完美信息） if there is at least one non-singleton information set.
		* meaning there is at least a dotted line in the tree form.

Prisoners Dilemma
![prisoners dilemma](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230316113717.png)


#### Strategy

##### Definition
A strategy (策略) for a player is a complete plan of actions. It specifies a feasible action for the player in every contingency in which the player might be called on to act.
* For dynamic games with complete information: 
	* A player’s strategy is a function which assigns an action to each information set (not each decision node) belonging to the player. 
	* 对每个选择节点，指定一个策略
* An action and a strategy do not make a big diference in static games, while they do in dynamic games.

##### Example
![example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230316111235.png)
* Player 1 has 2 actions (and also 2 strategies): L and R. Player 2 has 2 actions: L′ and R′, but 4 strategies:$$(L^\prime, L^\prime); (L^\prime, R^\prime); (R^\prime, L^\prime); (R^\prime, R^\prime)$$
* For example, the strategy $(L^\prime, R^\prime)$ means:
	* if player 1 plays L, then player 2 plays $L^\prime$;
	* if player 1 plays R, then player 2 plays $R^\prime$.


### Subgame-perfect Nash Equilibrium

##### Question: how to represent this game in normal form?
![same game](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230316111235.png)

* |          | $L^\prime L^\prime$ | $L^\prime R^\prime$      |$L^\prime L^\prime$| $L^\prime L^\prime$|
| --------     | -------- | ---------- | --- | --- |
| **L** | 3,1    | 3,1        |  1,2   | 1,2    |
| **R**    | 2,1      | 0,0 | 2,1    |  0,0   |
* there are two NE: $(L, R^\prime R^\prime)$, $(R, R^\prime L^\prime)$

##### Interpret
* NE $(R, R^\prime L^\prime)$ seems okay. It respects the spirit of backwards induction.
* NE $(L, R^\prime R^\prime)$ has a problem: No matter which action is chosen by Player 1, player 2 must choose L′ at the right node. 
* **Interpretation: Player 2 tells player 1: if you choose R, I will choose R′ （threat）, then each of us will get 0.** 
* This threat is non-creditable: Player 1 should not believe that player 2 will choose R′ after observing R. 
* Key: Ignorance of dynamic feature.


#### Subgame

###### Defination

* A subgame (子博弈) in an extensive-form game
	* begins at a decision node n that is a singleton information set （but is not the game’s initial node）; 
	* includes all the decision and terminal nodes following node n in the game tree （but no nodes that do not follow n）; 
	* does not cut any information sets （i.e., if a decision node n′ follows n in the game tree, then all other nodes in the information set containing n′ must also follow n, and so must be included in the subgame）.
	* **只能从一个singleton的decision node节点切出来，并且不能把任何information set切断**

* When focus on a subgame, we shall only consider the relevant part of the strategy profile s. 
* Relevant part of s specifies the “complete” plans （or strategy profile） for the players in that subgame.

###### Example
![example](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230317150643.png)

- We have a strategy profile $\left(L,\left(L^{\prime}, R^{\prime}\right),\left(L^{\prime \prime}, R^{\prime \prime}, R^{\prime \prime}, L^{\prime \prime}\right)\right)$.
- We turn to the subgame beginning at player 2's right decision node.
- The relevant part is $\left(R^{\prime},\left(R^{\prime \prime}, L^{\prime \prime}\right)\right)$ or $\left(-, R^{\prime},\left(R^{\prime \prime}, L^{\prime \prime}\right)\right)$. It is a strategy profile for this subgame.
	- We can discuss whether it is "reasonable", within this subgame.
- One can repeat this procedure for every subgame.

### Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium
##### Definition

A Nash equilibrium is subgame-perfect (子博弈精炼), or is said to be a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (子博弈精炼均衡) if the players’ strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium in every subgame.

##### Application
* It can be shown that any finite dynamic game of complete information has a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium, perhaps in mixed-strategies. 
* To find subgame-perfect Nash equilibria, 
	* we first need to find Nash equilibria in each subgame,
	* then use backwards-induction to solve for the whole game
* Subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is closely related to two previous concepts:
	* 1 backwards-induction outcome;
	* 2 subgame-perfect outcome. 
	* 两者仅存在术语的差别，没有什么本质区别；混用没有问题。 
* What’s the diference between an equilibrium and an outcome? 
	* **An equilibrium is a collection of players’ strategies (strategy profile), while an outcome is a collection of players’ actions.**

##### Equilibrium vs. Outcome

* Example：
	- The backwards-induction outcome is $\left(a_1^*, R_2\left(a_1^*\right)\right)$.
	- The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is $\left(a_1^*, R_2(\cdot)\right)$.
	- Note that $R_2\left(a_1^*\right)$ is an action, while $R_2(\cdot)$ is a strategy for player 2.
- In Example 1:
	- $\left(R, L^{\prime}\right)$ is the backwards-induction outcome,
	- while $\left(R,\left(R^{\prime}, L^{\prime}\right)\right)$ is the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium.
- In the Stackelberg model:
	- The backwards-induction outcome is $\left(q_1^*, q_2^*\right)$, where $q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{2}$ and $q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{4}$,
	- while the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is $\left(q_1^*, R_2\left(q_1\right)\right)$, where $R_2\left(q_1\right)=\frac{a-c-q_1}{2}$.
- For the two-stage game of complete but imperfect information
	* Then the subgame-perfect outcome is
$$(a_1^*, a_2^*, a_3^*(a_1^*, a_2^*), a_4^*(a_1^*, a_2^*)) .
$$
	- The subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is$$(a_1^*, a_2^*, a_3^*(a_1, a_2), a_4^*(a_1, a_2)) .$$

##### Nash Equilibrium vs. Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium

**A Nash equilibrium may not be subgame-perfect.**

* Following the example above.
	- The Nash equilibrium $\left(R,\left(R^{\prime}, L^{\prime}\right)\right)$ is subgame-perfect, because $R^{\prime}$ and $L^{\prime}$ are the optimal strategies in the left and right subgames, respectively, where player 2 is the only player.
	- On the other hand, the Nash equilibrium $\left(L,\left(R^{\prime}, R^{\prime}\right)\right)$ is not subgame-perfect, because when player 1 chooses $R, R^{\prime}$ is not optimal to player 2 in the right subgame, i.e., $R^{\prime}$ is not a Nash equilibrium in that subgame.
	- One can think the strategy $\left(R^{\prime}, R^{\prime}\right)$ by player 2 as a threat to player 1.
- Nash equilibria that rely on non-credible threats or promises can be eliminated by the requirement of subgame perfection.
- Subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium is a refinement of Nash equilibrium, i.e.,
	$\{ \text{Subgame-perfect Nash equilibria} \} \subseteq\{ \text{Nash equilibria} \}$


### Summary

- We have considered dynamic games of complete information.
- Two basic questions:
	* How to describe a dynamic situation $\rightarrow$ extensive-form representation.

## L4:Repeated games

* In a long-term relationship, one must consider how his/her current behavior will influence others’ behavior in the future, or how threats or promises about future behavior can afect current behavior. 
* In these dynamic situations, one might care about “reputation”, which is often used to describe how a person’s past actions affect future beliefs and behavior.

### Finitely repeated games

* The payoff of each player in the whole game is simply the sum of two payoffs in both stages （i.e., no discounting）.

#### Definition

* Let $G = ⟨A1 , . . . , An; u1, . . . , un⟩$ denote a static game of complete information in which players 1 through n simultaneously choose actions $a_1$ through an from the action spaces $A_1$ through $A_n$, and the payoffs are $u_1(a_1, . . . , a_n)$ through $u_n(a_1, . . . , a_n)$.
* The game G is called the stage game （阶段博弈） of the repeated game.
* Given a stage game G, let $G(T)$ denote the finitely repeated game in which G is played T times, with the outcomes of all preceding plays observed before the next play begins. The payoffs for $G(T)$ are simply the sum of the payoffs from the T stage games.

#### Proposition

* If the stage game G has a unique Nash equilibrium, then for any finite T, the repeated game $G(T)$ has a unique subgame-perfect outcome: the Nash equilibrium of G is played in every stage.
* if the stage game G has multiple Nash equilibria:
	* there may be subgame-perfect outcomes of the repeated game $G(T)$ in which, for any t < T, the outcome of stage t is not a Nash equilibrium of G.
	* 可以达到整体的更优化，因为可以用差的NE作为威胁。

### Infinitely repeated games

#### Definition

* Given a stage game G, let $G(∞, δ)$ denote the ininitely repeated game in which G is played forever and players share the discount factor $δ$.
* For each t, the outcomes of the t − 1 preceding plays are observed before the t-th stage begins. 
* Each player’s payoff in $G(∞, δ)$ is the present value of the player’s payoffs from the infinite sequence of stage games.

#### Strategies

* noncooperative strategy:
	* play one choice in every stage.
* （grim） trigger strategy （触发策略）: 
	* play A in the first stage; in stage t, if the outcome of all t − 1 preceding stages has been the binding choice, then play A; otherwise, play B.
* tit-for-tat （or tit for two tats） strategy （以牙还牙策略）
* carrot-and-stick strategy （or two-phase strategy） （胡萝卜加大棒策略）

#### Nash Equilibria

* 需要证明所有偏离的策略收益都不如现在的选择。

#### Subgame-perfect Nash Equilibria

* In an infinitely repeated game, a subgame is characterized by its previous history. The subgames can be grouped as follows:
	* Subgames whose previous histories are always a finite sequence of binding choice. 
		* 此时，判断是否要deviate。
	* Subgames whose previous histories contain other outcomes different from the binding choice.
		* 此时，选择NE是均衡
* 需要证明在每一个情况都是NE

* $\color{red}{\text{One-deviation principle (单阶段偏离原则)}}$ 
	* A strategy profile is a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium if and only if, for each player i and for each subgame, no single deviation would raise player i’s payoff in the subgame.


##### Two-phase strategy SPNE

* 胡萝卜加大棒策略
* in the first period, produce half of the monopoly quantity $q_m/2$. In period t, produce $q_m/2$ if both firms produce $q_m/2$ or both firms produce x in period t − 1; otherwise, produce x. 
* This strategy involve a （one-period） punishment phase in which the firm produces x and a （potentially infinite） collusive phase in which the firm produces $q_m/2$
* Such a strategy punishes
	* a firm for deviating from the collusive phase;
	* a firm for deviating from the punishment phase.

#### Folk theorem

##### Definition

* **Cooperative equilibria which do not exist in static games can be achieved in repeated games.**

##### Friedman Theorem

* Feasible Payoff
	* The payoffs $(x_1 , . . . , x_n)$ are feasible in the stage game G if they are a convex combination （i.e., a weighted average, where the weights are all nonnegative and sum to one） of the pure-strategy payoffs of G.
	* ![feasible payoff](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230403152406.png)
* Average Payoff
	* Given the discount factor $\delta$, the average payoff of the infinite sequence of payoffs $\pi_1, \pi_2, . . .$ is
	* $$(1-\delta )\sum_{i=1}^\infty \delta^{(t-1)}\pi_t$$
	* Both present value and average payoff can present a player’s payoff in an infinitely repeated game. 
	* Average payoff is directly comparable to the payoffs from the stage game.

* **Friedman Theorem**
	* Let G be a finite, static game of complete information. Let $(e_1,...,e_n)$ denote the payoffs from a Nash equilibrium of G, and let $(x_1,..., x_n)$ denote any feasible payoffs from G, where $x_i > e_i$ for each player i. If the discount factor $\delta$ is suiciently close to one, then there exists a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in the infinitely repeated game G( ∞, δ) that achieves $(x_1,..., x_n)$ as the average payoff.

## L5:Static games with incomplete information

### Intro
* games of complete information, i.e., each player’s payoff function is common knowledge among all players. 
* In the auction example, each player’s payoff function is no longer common knowledge:
	* Buyer i’s payof function contains private information, which is not known by other buyers. 
	* This is an example of incomplete information games （不完全信息博弈）, in which at least one player is uncertain about another player’s payoff function. 
* Games of incomplete information are also called Bayesian games （贝叶斯博弈）
	* Two types of Bayesian games: static vs. dynamic.

#### Cournot Competition under Asymmetric Information

* 类似与原本的古诺模型，但是现在firm2的成本 $c_2$ 有 $\theta$ 的可能性是 $c_H$ , 有 $1-\theta$ 的可能性是 $c_L$ 
* 因此，信息不对称：
	* Firm 1’s cost function is known by both firms.
		* $c_1$ is common knowledge.
	* Firm 2’s cost function is completely known by itself, but not known by firm 1.
		* $c_2$ is not common knowledge.
	* Firm 1 only knows the distribution of firm 2’s marginal cost
* 自然，firm 2会对于不同的成本选择不同的生产量
* firm 1 应该合理预期这种差异
* Let $q_2^*(c_H)$ and $q_2^*(c_L)$ denote firm 2’s quantity choices when its marginal cost is $c_H$ and $c_L$ respectively, and let $q^∗_1$ denote firm 1’s single choice of quantity.
* If firm 2’s cost is $c_j (j = L, H)$, it will choose $q^∗_2(c_j)$ to solve
	* $$\max_{q_2}(a-q1^*-q_2-c_j)q_2$$
* firm 1 chooses $q^∗_1$ to solve
	* $$\max_{q_1}\theta(a-q_2^*(c_H)-q_1-c)q_1+(1-\theta)(a-q_2^*(c_L)-q_1-c)q_1$$
* 一阶导数：
	* $$q_2^*(c_H) =\frac{a-q_1^*-c_H}{2}$$
	* $$q_2^*(c_L)=\frac{a-q_1^*-c_L}{2}$$
	* $$q_1^* =\frac{a-\theta q_2^*(c_H)-(1-\theta) q_2^*(c_L)-c}{2}$$
* The **equilibrium** of this game is $\left(q_1^*,\left(q_2^*\left(c_H\right), q_2^*\left(c_L\right)\right)\right)$, where
	* $$q_1^* =\frac{a-2 c+\theta c_H+(1-\theta) c_L}{3}$$
	* $$q_2^*(c_H) =\frac{a-2 c_H+c}{3}+\frac{1-\theta}{6}\left(c_H-c_L\right)$$
	* $$q_2^*(c_L)=\frac{a-2 c_L+c}{3}-\frac{\theta}{6}(c_H-c_L)$$
- We know $q_2^*(c_H)<q_2^*(c_L) \Rightarrow$ firm 2 produces less when its marginal cost increases.
* Firm 2 knows firm 1’s payoff function, while firm 1 does not know firm 2’s payoff functions but only knows the probability distribution. 
* This is Bayesian game.


### Static Bayesian games

* Consider a general static Bayesian game.
	- Let player $i$ 's possible payoff function be $u_i\left(a_1, \ldots, a_n ; t_i\right)$, where $a_i$ is player $i$ 's action and $t_i$ is called player $i$ 's type （类型）, which belongs to a set of possible types $T_i$ （or type spaces）.
	- Player $i$ 's type $t_i$ is his private information, and each type $t_i$ corresponds to a different payoff function of player $i$.
	- Let $t_{-i}=\left(t_1, \ldots, t_{i-1}, t_{i+1}, \ldots, t_n\right)$ be the types of other players and $T_{-i}$ be the set of all $t_{-i}$.
	- Player $i$ is uncertain about other players' types, but only knows the probability distribution $p_i\left(t_{-i} \mid t_i\right)$ on $T_{-i}$, which is i’s belief （猜测/估计/信念） about other players' types, given i's knowledge of his own $t_i$.

##### Definition

* The normal-form (标准式) representation of an $n$-player static Bayesian game specifies players'
(1) action spaces $A_1, \ldots, A_n$,
(2) type spaces $T_1, \ldots, T_n$,
(4) payoff functions $u_1, \ldots, u_n$.
* We denote this game by
$$
G=\left\langle A_1, \ldots, A_n ; T_1, \ldots, T_n ; p_1, \ldots, p_n ; u_1, \ldots, u_n\right\rangle
$$

##### Example

* In the Cournot game with asymmetric information,
	- $A_{\ell}=A_2=[0, \infty)$
	- $T_1=\{c\}$, and $T_2=\{c_H, c_L\}$
		- 至少是singleton
	- $p_1\left(c_H \mid c\right)=\theta, p_1\left(c_L \mid c\right)=1-\theta$, and $p_2\left(c \mid c_H\right)=p_2\left(c \mid c_L\right)=1$
	- Payoff functions are
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi_1\left(q_1, q_2 ; c\right) & =\left(a-q_1-q_2-c\right) q_1 \\\\
\pi_2\left(q_1, q_2 ; c_L\right) & =\left(a-q_1-q_2-c_L\right) q_2 \\\\
\pi_2\left(q_1, q_2 ; c_H\right) & =\left(a-q_1-q_2-c_H\right) q_2
\end{aligned}
$$

##### timing

* The timing of a static Bayesian game:
	1. Nature draws a type vector $t = (t_1 ,..., t_n)$, where $t_i ∈ T_i$ ;
	2. Nature reveals $t_i$ to player i, but not to any other players;
	3. The players simultaneously choose actions, player i choosing $a_i ∈ A_i$; 
	4. Payoffs $u_i (a_1 ,..., a_n;t_i)$ are received.
* By introducing the frictional moves by nature in 1 and 2, we have described a game of incomplete information as a game of imperfect information.

##### Bayes' rule

* We often assume that the nature draws $t=\left(t_1, \ldots, t_n\right)$ according to the prior probability distribution $p(t)$ （先验概率分布/事前概率分布）, which is common knowledge.
- Then the posterior belief $p_i\left(t_{-i} \mid t_i\right)$ can be computed by Bayes' rule 贝叶斯公式
$$
p_i\left(t_{-i} \mid t_i\right)=\frac{p\left(t_{-i}, t_i\right)}{\sum_{t_{-i}^{\prime} \in T_{-i}} p\left(t_{-i}^{\prime}, t_i\right)} .
$$

##### Remarks

* First, there are games in which player i has private information not only about his or her own payoff function but also about another player’s payoff function. We write player i’s payoff function as $u_i (a_1 , . . . , a_n; t_1, . . . , t_n)$. （interdependent （相互决定））
* Second, we typically assume that players’ types are independent （otherwise, correlated）, i.e., $p_i(t_{−i} |t_i)$ does not depend on $t_i$, which can be denoted by $p_i(t_{−i})$. But $p_i(t_{−i})$ is still derived from the prior distribution $p(t)$.

#### Strategy and Bayesian Nash equilibrium

* In the static Bayesian game $G = ⟨A_1 , . . . , A_n; T_1, . . . , T_n; p_1, . . . , p_n; u_1, . . . , u_n⟩$, a strategy for player i is a function $s_i(t_i)$, i.e., $s_i: T_i → A_i$. For given type $t_i$, $s_i(t_i)$ gives an action of player i. Player i’s strategy space $S_i$ is the set of all functions from $T_i$ into $A_i$.
* 在上例中，$(q^*_2(c_H),q^*_2(c_L))$ 是player 2 的一个策略，$q^*_1$ 是player 1 的一个策略

##### Definition 
* In the static Bayesian game
* $G=\langle A_1, \ldots, A_n ; T_1, \ldots, T_n ; p_1, \ldots, p_n ; u_1, \ldots, u_n\rangle$, the strategy profile $s^*=(s_1^*, \ldots, s_n^*)$ are a （pure-strategy） Bayesian Nash equilibrium （贝叶斯-纳什均衡） if for each player $i$ and for each of $i$ 's types $t_i \in T_i, s_i^*\left(t_i\right)$ solves
* $$\max _{a_i \in A_i} \sum_{t_{-i} \in T_{-i}} u_i(s_{-i}^*(t_{-i}), a_i ; t_i) \cdot p_i(t_{-i} \mid t_i) .$$
* 先验分布下不同情况的收益加权。
- In a general finite static Bayesian game （finite players, finite actions, and finite types）, a Bayesian Nash equilibrium exists, perhaps in mixed strategies.

* In a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, each player’s strategy is a best response to other players’ strategies. 
* In other words, no player wants to change his or her strategy unilaterally given other players’ equilibrium strategies, even if the change involves only one action by one type. 
* A Bayesian Nash equilibrium is simply a Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian game. 

### Application

#### A trading game 

* 可以把带有概率的game转化成多个人，每个人代表一种possibility
* ![extensive form of the game](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230403194427.png)
* Normal-form representation of the game:
	* Action spaces: A1 = {B, N} and A2 = {P, N};
	* Type spaces: T1 = {10, 14} and T2 = {1};
	* Beliefs:the buyer’s belief on the seller’s type is 1 on type 1, the seller’s belief on the buyer’s types is 2/3 on 10 and 1/3 on 14;
	* Payoffs are given as above.
* Strategy spaces: S1 = {BB, BN, NB, NN} and S2 = {P, N} 
	* The meaning of BN: the buyer with outside option 10 chooses “to buy” and with outside option 14 chooses “not to buy”.
* 可以用bi-matrix来表示这个状态，找到best response

#### Mixed strategies revisited

* 考虑 battle of sexes
* Suppose the couple are uncertain about the payoffs for each other
* |          |   Opera    |  Football  |
| --------:|:----------:|:----------:|
|    **Opera** | 1，2+$t_w$ |    0,0     |
| **Football** |    0,0     | 2+$t_h$, 1 |

* Here $t_w$ is privately known by the wife, while $t_h$ is privately known by the husband. 
* Assume that $t_w$ and $t_h$ are independently drawn from a uniform distribution on $[0, x]$, where x > 0.
* The normal-form representation of this static Bayesian game is $G=\left\langle A_h, A_w ; T_h, T_p ; p_h, p_w ; u_h, u_w\right\rangle$ :
	- $A_h=A_w=\{ \text{Opera, Football} \}$;
	- $T_h=T_w=[0, x]$
	- The husband believes that $t_w$ （the wife believes that $t_h$ ） is uniformly distributed on $[0, x]$;
	- $u_h$ and $u_w$ are given before.
- 构造两个 critical value, $\bar{t_w}$ 和 $\bar{t_h}$ 
	- In the Bayesian Nash equilibrium, the husband will choose Football if $t_h$ exceeds the critical value $\bar{t_h}$, and choose Opera otherwise.
	- 老婆同理

##### 解
- Given the wife's strategy, the husband's expected payoffs of choosing Opera and Football are
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_h\left(\text { Opera, } s_w^* \mid t_h\right) & =\operatorname{Pr}\left(s_w^*=\text { Opera }\right) \cdot 1+\operatorname{Pr}\left(s_w^*=\text { Football }\right) \cdot 0 \\\\
& =\left(1-\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x}\right) \cdot 1+\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x} \cdot 0=1-\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x},
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
u_h\left(\text { Football, } s_w^* \mid t_h\right)=\left(1-\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x}\right) \cdot 0+\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x} \cdot\left(2+t_h\right)=\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x}\left(2+t_h\right) .
$$
- Thus, choosing Opera is optimal iff
$$
1-\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x} \geq \frac{\bar{t}_w}{x}\left(2+t_h\right) \Longleftrightarrow t_h \leq \frac{x}{\bar{t}_w}-3=\bar{t}_h .
$$
* wife 同理
* $$1-\frac{\bar{t}_h}{x} \geq \frac{\overline{\bar{t}}_h}{x}\left(2+t_w\right) \Longleftrightarrow t_w \leq \frac{x}{\bar{t}_h}-3=\bar{t}_w .$$
* Solving simultaneously, we obtain $\bar{t}_h$ and $\bar{t}_w$ satisfy
$$
t^2+3 t-x=0 .
$$
- Thus, $\bar{t}_h=\bar{t}_w=\frac{\sqrt{9+4 x}-3}{2}$.
- In equilibrium, the husband plays Opera with probability $p^*$ and Football with probability $1-p^*$, while the wife plays Football with probability $p^*$ and Opera with probability $1-p^*$, where
$$
p^*=\frac{\bar{t}_h}{x}=\frac{\bar{t}_w}{x}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{9+4 x+3}} .
$$
- When $x \rightarrow 0$, we get that $p^* \rightarrow \frac{1}{3}$.
- As the incomplete information disappears, the players' behavior in this pure-strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium approaches their behavior in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in the original game of complete information.

## L6: Auction

### Intro

* An auction is a mechanism of allocating goods.
	* Analyze bidders’ behaviors.
	* Analyze auctioneer’s “optimal” choice. 
* Advantages of auctions:
	* a simple way of determining the market-based prices; 
	* more flexible than setting a fixed price; 
	* can usually achieve eiciency by allocating the resources to those who value them most highly.

#### Types of auctions

* Number of objects
	* A single object or many? 
* Open vs. sealed-bid
	* Do you know the bids of other participants? 
* One-sided vs. two-sided
	* Do buyers and sellers both submit bids, or just buyers? 
* Private value vs. common value
	* Do the bidders have the same valuation for the object?

### Second-price auction

* 每个人的心理预期是从一个分布中随机的，$F_i(·)$
* 每个人都只知道自己的心理预期但不知道别人的
* 所有人同时竞价
* 出价最高者赢得物品，并支付第二高价格
* 如果同时好几个人出价最高，则随机给到一个人

#### 结论

* For each player i, the strategy of bidding his valuation （i.e., $s^∗_i(v_i) = v_i$ ）weakly dominates all other strategies.
	* 分别考虑报价更低与更高，都是 weakly dominates



### First-price auction

* 两个bidder，valuation在（0，1）上服从uniform distribution
* 只知道自己的valuation
* 同时bid
* 出价高者得，出价低者不用出钱
* 出价相同，随机获得

* Normal-form representation of this static Bayesian game $G=\left\langle A_1, A_2 ; T_1, T_2 ; p_1, p_2 ; u_1, u_2\right\rangle$
	- $A_1=A_2=[0, \infty)$, and each bid is $b_i \in A_i$;
	- $T_1=T_2=[0,1]$, and each valuation is $v_i \in T_i$;
	- Player $i$ believes that $v_j$ is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$;
	- The payoff $u_i\left(b_i, b_j ; v_i\right)$ is
	- $$u_i(b_i, b_j ; v_i)= \begin{cases}v_i-b_i, & \text { if } b_i>b_j \\\\ \frac{1}{2}(v_i-b_i), & \text { if } b_i=b_j \\\\ 0, & \text { if } b_i<b_j\end{cases}$$
- Bidder $i$ 's strategy is a function $b_i(v_i)$ from $[0,1]$ to $[0, \infty)$.
- $(b_1^*(v_1), b_2^*(v_2))$ is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium if and only if for each player $i$ and each type $v_i \in[0,1], b_i^*\left(v_i\right)$ solves
- $$\begin{aligned}
& \max _{b_i \geq 0} \mathbf{E}_{v_j} u_i(b_i, b_j^*(v_j) ; v_i) \\\\
= & \max _{b_i \geq 0}\{eft(v_i-b_i) \operatorname{Prob}[b_i>b_j^*(v_j)]+\frac{v_i-b_i}{2} \operatorname{Prob}[b_i=b_j^*(v_j)]\} .
\end{aligned}$$

#### Linear Bayesian NE

* 可能会有许多纳什均衡，现在只考虑线性情况
	* $b^*_1(v_1)=a_1+c_1v_1$ , $b^*_2(v_2)=a_2+c_2v_2$
* 需要找到对应的a和c
* 理性：
	* a小于1，不然收益永远为负
	* c大于等于0，随着valuation上升，出价也上升
	* a大于等于0，出价不能为负
* 当 $b_j$ 是线性的时候，$Prob(b_i=a_j+c_jv_j)=Prob(v_j=\frac{b_i-a_j}{c_j})=0$ 
* 对于任意的v，需要
* $$\max_{b_i\geq 0}(v_i-b_i)Prob(v_j<\frac{b_i-a_j}{c_j})$$
- Since $b_j^*\left(v_j\right)=a_j+c_j v_j \in\left[a_j, a_j+c_j\right]$, we can restrict our attention to $b_i \in\left[a_j, a_j+c_j\right]$ 
	- i.e., $b_i<a_j$ is pointless, while $b_i>a_j+c_j$ is not rational
- Under the above restriction, we know
$$
0 \leq \frac{b_i-a_j}{c_j} \leq 1
$$
- Player $i$ s best response solves
$$
\max _{a_j \leq b_i \leq a_j+c_j}\left(v_i-b_i\right) \frac{b_i-a_j}{c_j}
$$
* FOC implies the potentially optimal choice is $b_i^o=\frac{v_i+a_j}{2}$.
	* 即求导
- It is the optimal choice iff $b_i^o=\frac{v_i+a_j}{2} \in\left[a_j, a_j+c_j\right]$ 
	- 即 $a_j \leq v_i \leq a_j+2 c_j$.
- The best response function of bidder $i$ is
$$
b_i\left(v_i\right)= \begin{cases}a_j, & \text { if } v_i \leq a_j \\\\ \frac{1}{2}\left(v_i+a_j\right), & \text { if } a_j<v_i \leq a_j+2 c_j \\\\ a_j+c_j, & \text { if } v_i>a_j+2 c_j .\end{cases}
$$
* We want the equilibrium bid $b_i\left(v_i\right)$ to be a linear function on $[0,1]$.
- There are three cases:
- $$[0,1] \subseteq\{\begin{array}{l}
(-\infty, a_j] \\\\
{[a_j, a_j+2 c_j]} \\\\
{[a_j+2 c_j, \infty)}
\end{array}.$$
	* 第一种情况不满足a小于1
	* 第三种情况不满足c大于0
	* 因此只能是第二种情况，$b_i=\frac{v_i+a_j}{2}$
* In a Bayesian Nash equilibrium,$$b_i^*\left(v_i\right)=a_i+c_i v_i=\frac{1}{2}\left(v_i+a_j\right)$$for all $v_i \in[0,1]$.
- Then we have$$a_i=\frac{1}{2} a_j, \text { and } c_i=\frac{1}{2}$$for $i, j=1,2$ and $i \neq j$.
- Therefore,
$$
a_1=a_2=0, \text { and } c_1=c_2=\frac{1}{2} .
$$
- The unique linear Bayesian Nash equilibrium is$$b_1^*(v_1)=\frac{1}{2} v_1, \text { and } b_2^*(v_2)=\frac{1}{2} v_2$$

* **如果能直接猜出这个解，就可以直接验证。**
