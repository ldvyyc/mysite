6. Name the risks embedded in the fixed income markets. Can you explain them in your language?
	* interest rate risk
		* risk that interest rate will rise
	* credit risk
		* default risk
		* credit spread risk: reflect how risky the issuer
		* downgrade risk
	* liquidity risk
		* measure: bid-ask spread


## Fixed income basics
1. Define simple interest and compounding interest.
	* simple interest: interest is calculated based on the outstanding principal amount only.
	* compound interest: interest is calculated based on the sum of outstanding principal amount and accumulated interests, that is, interest on interest.
2. Describe how to price perpetuity, annuity, zero-coupon bond, and coupon bond
	* $$P_{perpetuity}=\frac{C}{r}$$
	* $$P_{annuity}=\frac{A}{r}[1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}]$$
		* 两个perpetuity相减
	* zero rate一年以内，spot rate推算出来的
		* spot rate必须从今天开始
	* coupon bond: 对应每个时期的spot rate折现
3. What is the spot rate?
	* Spot （zero） rate is the yield to maturity of a default-free zero-coupon （pure discount） bond.
4. What is a STRIPS?
	* Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities
	* 例如把一个30-year treasury bond拆成60个coupon payment和一个par payment，就构造了61个新的证券，零息的
5. The US Treasury bills are quoted in discount yield. How to translate between discount yield and bond equivalent yield?
	* $$d=\frac{100-P}{100}\times \frac{360}{n}$$
	* $$\color{red}{BEY=\frac{100-P}{P}\times \frac{365}{n}=\frac{365d}{360-nd}}$$
		* 这里MAT<182，d是（bid+ask）/2
6. Describe the relationships between dirty price, flat price, and accrued interest.
	* $$\color{red}{P_t^{FULL}=P_t^{FLAT}+AI_t}$$
7. What is yield to maturity? Do you understand the relationships between coupon rate, current yield, and yield to maturity for par, premium, and discount bonds?
	* YTM, is the discount rate at which the present value of all future promised cash flows of a bond equals its price.
	* YTM is bond-specific!
	* Assumptions embedded in YTM:
		* All cash flows received during the lifetime of the bond are reinvested at the same YTM;
		* The bond is held till its maturity.
	* ![relationship](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230329002504.png)

#### Yield measures

* Bond equivalent yield
	* $$BEY=periodic\times n$$
	* for semiannual bond, n = 2
* Effictive annual yield
	* $$EAY=(1+periodic)^n-1$$
* Current yield
	* $$CY=\frac{\text{dollar interest}}{\text{market price}}$$

#### some relationships

* For par bond （price = par）
	* coupon yield = current yield = YTM
* For discount bond （price < par）
	* coupon yield < current yield < YTM
* For premium bond （price > par）
	* coupon yield > current yield > YTM

**YTM = coupon yield + capital gain yield**

![relationship](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230329002504.png)

* YTM is not HPR （holding period return）
	* 只有当hold the bond to maturity 才是

#### Hypothesis of yield curve

* Expectations theory: 期望理论
	* the term structure reflects the market's expectations of future interest rates.
* Preferred habitat theory: 
	* different bond investors prefer a particular maturity length over another, and they are only willing to buy bonds outside of their maturity preference if risk premia for other maturity ranges are available.
* Liquidity preference theory: 流动性偏好理论
	* investors prefer cash or other highly liquid holdings, suggesting that an investor should demand a higher interest rate or premium on securities with long-term maturities that carry greater risk because, all other factors being equal.
* Market segmentation theory: 市场分割理论
	* the market for each segment of bond maturities consists mainly of investors who have a preference for investing in securities with specific durations: short, intermediate, or long-term.


## Repurchase agreement （repo） and China’s policy interest rate system
1. Describe repo and reverse repo. What are their functions in the fixed income markets?
	* Repurchase agreement (repo) is a contract under which the seller sells a security on the initiation date with an deal to repurchase it at a higher price on a specified later date.
		* used to borrow short-term money
	* Purpose of reverse repo is to borrow security using cash as collateral, a monetary policy tool, in order to inject liquidity to the market
1. Describe special repo versus general repo.
2. Describe pledged repo and outright repo in China.
3. Describe China’s policy interest rate system.
4. Describe China’s interest rate corridor.

这里的例子存疑，special repo也存疑。


## Treasury securities
1. Classify China’s Treasury bonds.
	* liabilities of central government issued by ministry of finance.
	* types
		* book-entry, 记账式, for whole-sale
			* issued to institution and limited investors, can be traded in secondary market
			* primary market tender offer to underwriting syndicate
			* secondary market: SSE and SZSE, OTC, interbank and bank counter
		* savings, 储蓄式, for retail
			* non-tradable
			* primary market issued to underwriters（banks）

2. Describe the issue process of China’s book-entry Treasury bonds.
	* tender offer: 
		* competitive bid: both price and quantity
		* non-competitive bid: only quantity, accept price
			* typically available for class-A members and for coupon bearing bond with mat less than 10 yrs.
		* initially issues of coupon bearing bond uses rate, discounting bond uses price
		* bid position：1 basis point or in announcement
		* bidding restrictions
		* bidding amount: 
			* max: 35% for A, 25% for B
			* min: 4% for A, 1.5% for B
			* min underwriting amount：1% for A, 0.2% for B
		* rank winning bids: sort by lower rate or higher price, add the amount from the best until market clear. Then before equilibrium price/rate, each get their treasury, at the equilibrium, weighted average by the bidding amount, and give the remaining to the one bids earlier. to two decimal places.

3. Describe multiple price/discriminatory auction, uniform price auction, and modified multiple price auction.
	* multiple price/discriminatory auction： each winning bid receive the rate it proposes.
	* uniform price auction: all winning bid receive highest rate that the market clears
	* modified multiple price：rate is weighted average of winning bids. bidding with lower rate pay par price, bidding with higher rate pay discount price（with regard to their bidding rate）

4. Describe when-issued （WI） trading. What are the benefits of WI trading?
	* When-issued （WI） is a transaction or trade in securities that are not yet issued, on the understanding that the trade will be settled once the securities are issued.
	* occurs between announcement date and issue date
	* special kind of future for non-existing securities
	* benefit:
		* information discovery, known what the investor want for interest rate and quantity.
	* downside:
		* short squeeze
		* repo specialness

5. What does short squeeze mean?
	* ![short sqeeze](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230328162758.png)

## Duration and convexity
1. Describe the price-yield relationship.
	* inverse convex relationship between price and yield. negative correspond

2. Define and explain duration. What bond features affect duration?
	* loosely speaking: average time to receive all the cash flow.
	* $P=\sum_{i=1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}$, duration is expressed as
	* $$D=\frac{\sum_{i-1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}\times t_i}{P}$$
	* no unit
	* duration is interest rate risk measure.
	* modified duration: $$MD=-\frac{\frac{\partial P}{P}}{\partial y}\approx -\frac{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}{\Delta y}$$
	* $$D^{Macaulay}=-\frac{dP/P}{d(1+y)/(1+y)}=-\frac{dP/P}{dy}(1+y)$$

3. Describe price value of one basis point （PVBP/DV01）. What is the relationship between duration and PVBP?
	* change in the price due to a change in interest rate
	* $$PVBP=\sum_{i-1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}\times t_i=DP$$

4. Describe the properties of duration.
	* A zero-coupon bond's duration equals its maturity, implying that the zero-coupon bond is the most interest-rate-elastic instrument for a given maturity.
	* A coupon bond's duration is less than its maturity.
		* Duration increases with maturity.
		* Duration decreases with coupon rate and yield to maturity.
		* Duration is time-varying.
	* As a linear approximation of the price-yield relationship, duration may not work well for significant shifts in the term structure.
	* Duration works only for parallel shifts in the term structure and may fail miserably if the term structure tilts while shifting parallelly.

5. Describe the logic behind duration hedging and the spread trading strategy?
	* changing slope of the term structure.
	* need curvature change
	* short the long bond and long the short bond
	* equation of duration-neutral
	* result might not be so amazing
		* main reason: bid-ask spread
		* haircut, repo rate

6. Describe dollar convexity and relative convexity.
	* $$$Conv=\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}=\sum_{i=1}^NC_ie^{-yt_i}(t_i)^2$$
	* $$RConv=\frac{$Conv}{P}=\frac{\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}}{P}$$
	* Convexity is the change in the slope of the price-yield curve for a slight change in the yield.
	* $$\color{red}{\frac{dP}{P}=\frac{\frac{\partial P}{P}}{\partial y}dy + \frac{\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial y^2}}{2P}(dy)^2}$$

7. What bond features affect convexity?
	* convexity is the change in the slope of the price-yield curve for a slight change in the yield.
	* The main bond features that affect convexity are:

	1. Coupon rate: Bonds with lower coupon rates have higher convexity than bonds with higher coupon rates.

	1. Maturity: Longer-term bonds have higher convexity than shorter-term bonds.

	1. Yield: Bonds with lower yields have higher convexity than bonds with higher yields.

	1. Call provisions: Callable bonds have lower convexity than non-callable bonds.

	1. Put provisions: Bonds with put options have higher convexity than bonds without put options.

	1. Credit quality: Lower-rated bonds have higher convexity than higher-rated bonds.

	1. Volatility: Bonds with higher volatility have higher convexity than bonds with lower volatility.

8. What securities have negative convexity? Why?
	* Callable bonds usually exhibit negative convexity at lower yields. The price of a callable bond might drop as the likelihood that the bond will be called increases, and the shape of a callable bond's curve of price to yield is concave or negatively convex.
	* Most mortgage securities exhibit negative convexity due to the mortgage borrower's incentive to refinance at a lower rate when market yields decline.

9. Describe the butterfly trading strategy. What risks is it exposed to?
	* establishing a duration-neutral strategy, but relative convexity is positive.
	* Underlying, it is trading flattening. If it goes flattening, it will be more earning.
	* See as two spread trading composed.
	* need curvature change



## Constructing the term structure
1. For pricing, we need to have the term structure of spot rates. We apply bootstrapping and interpolation to construct it.
	* bootstraping: self-starting process without external inputs
	* interpolation: using givin points to estimate unknown points

2. Describe bootstrapping. How to apply it?
	* 

3. Describe interpolation and name the approaches. Do you know how to apply them?

4. Do you know how to construct a forward curve from the spot curve （or based on zero prices）?


## Interest rate modeling
1. Describe the standard and general Wiener processes.
	* Wiener process （standard Brownian motion）


1. Why do we need to specify the short rate process in interest rate modeling?
	* to better describe fixed income securities whose cash flow depend on future movements of interest rate.
	* reflect real interest rate fluctuation
	* model provide the prob. distribution of outcomes at important future time, which then can be used to compute expected value


1. Describe the desirable properties of an interest rate model. Can we have all of them in one single model? If not, how should we make the trade-off?
	* Economic soundness: non-negativity of interest rate, mean reversion.
	* Reasonable distribution of spot rates at given maturity
	* correlation structure between interest rate of different mat.
	* volatility structure of interest rate
	* tractability: analytical solution
	* tradeoff:
		* depend on application.

1. Describe the main characteristics of the Vasicek model and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross （CIR） model. What are their pros and cons?
	* Vasicek: 
		* short rate follow Brownian motion, $dr_t=\kappa (\mu - r_t)dt+\sigma dW_t$
		* zero coupon bond price can be priced
		* calibrate model to estimate coefficient and apply to other bond
		* Main character
			* Continuous time one factor model
			* Allow negative interest rates
			* simple, closed-form solution
			* Not for perfect calibration
		* Vasicek: short rate -- underlying bond -- price of option
	* CIR:
		* short rate follow Brownian motion, $dr_t=\kappa (\mu - r_t)dt+\sigma \sqrt{r}dW_t$
		* zero coupon bond price can be priced
		* Main character
			* Continuous time one factor model
			* No negative interest rates
			* simple, closed-form solution
			* Not for perfect calibration
	* They have closed-form solution, but not very precise.

1. The Black-Derman-Toy model perhaps is the most popular interest rate model. Can you describe how to apply it to price the options attached to a bond?
	* if short rate follow Geometric Brownian motion, $$dlnr(t)=[\theta (t)-\frac{\partial \sigma (t)/\partial t}{\sigma (t)}lnr(t)]dt+\sigma (t)dW_t$$
		* then, $r(t+1)=r(t)e^{\theta \pm \sigma}$
	* if short rate follow Brownian motion, 
		* $r(t+1)=r(t)+\theta \pm \sigma$
	* using bivariate lattice to price options
	* model is callibrated to market yields and volatilities


3. Describe analytical solution versus numerical solutions （binomial tree and Monte Carlo simulation）. What are their advantages and drawbacks?
	* with tree, can estimate discount bond price, spot rate, forward rate, interest rate derivative price
	* numerical are much more time and space consuming.


## Interest rate derivatives
1. Describe interest rate swap （IRS）. How to compute the fixed rate of an IRS? We have introduced two approaches in class.
	* life of an IRS is called swap term
	* if payments are made at the end of the period, it is said to be settled in arrears
	* payer is payer of the fixed rate
	* receiver face greater interest rate risk, because receiver is essentially holding a long term bond
	* first payment date = second reset date
	* compute fixed swap rate:
		* first way, hedged swap have 0 NPV
		* $$\sum_{i=1}^NP(0,t_i)[R-r_0(t_{i-1},t_i)]=0$$
		* $$R=\sum_{i=1}^N[\frac{P(0,t_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^NP(0,t_j)}]r_0(t_{i-1},t_i)$$
		* weighted average of floating rate
		* second way, for par coupon bond
		* $$\sum_{i=1}^NP(0,t_i)R+P_0(0,t_n)=\sum_{i=1}^NP(0,t_i)r_0(t_{i-1},t_i)+P_0(0,t_n)=1$$
		* $$R=\frac{1-P_0(0,t_n)}{\sum_{i=1}^NP_0(0,t_i)}$$
	* who pays who? earning less pays to earning more, and eliminate the swap.
	* swap spread: the spread between fixed rate and YTM of underlying treasury

2. Describe forward and futures contracts. What are the key differences between them?
	* forward contract is an agreement entered by two parties. One agree to buy, the other agree to sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price on a specified date in future.
		* on the settlement date, the seller is obligated to deliver the asset, price at forward price.
		* assigned between two parties
	* Futures are similar to forward, agreement on deliver some asset to the other party on the settlement date on the agreed price.
		* doing so in exchange market.
		* have regulations
		* trade via margin
		* highly liquid
		* broker account change every day
	* Financial futures: stock index futures, interest rate futures, currency futures

3. Describe conversion factor.
	* conversion factors link the different prices of the eligible bonds and the price of a reference bond. because future prices are quoted on a reference bond with same maturity.
	* each bond have a unique conversion factor.
	* Delivery bond price = CF ✖️ Reference bond price
	* CF does not change over time.

4. Describe the options embedded in a Treasury futures contract.
	* Quality: can deliver any eligible bond--cheapest to deliver
	* timing: delivery notice can be given in a period, not only on a month.
	* wildcard: future exchange close early, but bond keep trading.
	* end-of-month: future trading stop before the end of month.

5. What is the cheapest-to-deliver （CTD） bond? How to determine the CTD bond?
	* maximize for the shorter.
	* 3 ways to characterize CTD:
		* CTD has cheapest forward invioce price
		* It has highest implied repo rate（IRR）, which is the theoretical rate of return the short could earn by purchasing the cash security and delivering it into futures contract.
		* It has lowest basis after carry or net basis.
			* basis is the difference between cash price and adjusted futures price.

6. Describe the call （put） option on a futures contract.
	* European option: only exercised at the expiration date
	* American: exercised at any time up to expiration date
	* Bermudan and Atlantic: before expiration date, but only certain date.



## Credit risk and derivatives

1. Describe default, financial distress, workout, bankruptcy, and their relationships.
	* default: failure to meet the legal obligations of a loan
	* financial distress: its liquid assets are not sufficient to meet the requirements of its obligations（before default）
		* solutions
		* restructuring assets: asset sales, fire sales
		* private workout: debt restructuring to reduce par, extend maturity, debt fot equity swap
	* workout means the company is in financial distress, fundamentally good, while if no need to workout means it is in economic distress and is fundamentally bad
	* bankruptcy: when workout fails, defaulted firm enter into bankruptcy. It is a legal status
		* Chapter 7: liquidation, sale of nonexempt property and distribution of the proceeds to creditors.
		* Chapter 11: reorganization, debtor remain in possession, but creditors have some power.

2. Credit rating:
	* Describe the rating grades.
		* shows the probability that a firm may default
	* What is the threshold between the investment and speculative ("junk") grades?
		* for Moody's, Baa3 and above is investment, Ba and below is junk
		* for Std Poor's, BBB- and above is investment, BB+ and below is junk
	* Describe the key features of Chinese domestic agency ratings.
		* almost no A- and below, tend to report very good
		* only AAA can be public fund.
		* cliff downgrading often occur.
		* upgrade more than downgrade
		* underestimate the default risk
		* issuer paid rating is higher than investor paid ratings

3. How do we quantify credit risk? What are the drivers for credit spread?
	* using credit spread
	* credit spread is typically viewed as the difference between YTM of a risky security and the YTM of a treasury with same maturity.

5. Describe the credit scoring model. What are the pros and cons of it?
	* Altman's Z-score model
	* short-term liquidity, internel growth potential measure, profitability, leverage, efficiency
	* limitations
		* theoretical foundation
		* frequency of data
		* Impact of different industry and general economic situation
		* Nonlinearity of impact of credit factors on default prob.

6. Describe the dynamics of a structural form model of credit risk, e.g., as in Merton (1974).
	* equity is analogous to a call option on the firm's assets
	* debt is analogous to a risk free bond and a short put option

8. Describe Moody’s KMV’s EDF.

9. How to estimate distance-to-default? Can you outline how KMV maps distance-to-default to EDF?

10. Describe the dynamics of a reduced form model of credit risk, and discuss its difference from the structural form model in mechanism and application process.

11. Describe credit default swap (CDS). Can you outline how to price a CDS?
