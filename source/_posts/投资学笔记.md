## 基本目标

* Asset pricing: equity, bonds, derivatives
* Asset allocation
* Consumption timing
* Financial engineering

* AN INVESTMENT IS the current commitment of money or other resources in the expectation of reaping future benefits
* These investment decisions are made in a competitive environment where
	* higher returns usually can be obtained only at the price of greater risk
	* it is rare to find assets that are so mispriced as to be obvious bargains.


## Overview

* Financial assets
	* Claims on real assets
	* Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, bank deposits（银行存款）, investment accounts（投资账户）, and cash
* real assets generate net income to the economy 
* financial assets simply define the **allocation of income or wealth** among investors
	* 金融资产只是在投资者之间进行分配
* Financial assets are aggregated out and the total balance sheet for a country contains only real assets
* 金融资产流动性更高
* 金融资产更难定价

### 金融市场和经济

* informational role
	* 资金流向前景最好的公司
	* 与股价相关
* 投资时间
	* 通过securities将消费推迟到下个周期
* 分散风险
	* select securities consistent with their tastes for risk
	* the firms that need to raise capital as security can be sold for the best possible price
* Separation of Ownership and Management

#### Mechanisms to mitigate agency problems:

* Tie managers' income to the success of the firm （stock options）
* Monitoring from the board of directors
* Monitoring from the large outside investors and security analysts
* Takeover threat

### Investment Process

#### composition
* Portfolios
* Asset classes 
	* stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities,… 
* Asset Allocation
* The security selection
	* Investment choice of which particular securities to hold within each asset class
	* Security analysis: the valuation of particular securities

#### process

* “Top-down” approach
	* 先从资源配置出发，再具体到证券或股票
	* First step: Asset allocation
	* Second step: security selection 
* “Bottom-up” approach
	* Investment based solely on security  selection 
	* Disadvantage: may result in unintended heavy weight of a portfolio in only one or another sector of the economy
	* Advantage: focus the portfolio on the assets that seem to offer the most attractive investment opportunities

### Competitive Market

no “free lunches” 

* $\color{red}{\text{Risk-Return Trade-Off}}$
	* If you want higher expected returns, you will have to pay a price by accepting higher risk
* Diversification
	* When we mix assets into diversified portfolios, we need to consider the interplay among assets and the effect of diversification on the risk of the entire portfolio\
* 有效市场假说
	* In fully efficient markets when prices quickly adjust to all relevant information, there should be neither underpriced nor overpriced securities

* Passive Management（被动投资）
	* 接受市场大盘
	* Holding a highly diversified portfolio（分散投资）
	* No attempt to find undervalued securities
	* No attempt to time the market
* Active Management（主动投资）
	* Finding mispriced securities（选股）
	* Timing the market（择时）

### Players

* Demanders of capital – Firms（企业部门） 
	* Net borrowers of fund: raise capital to pay for investments in plant and equipment
	* income generated by those real assets provides the returns to investors who purchase the securities issued by the firm.
* Suppliers of capital – Households（住户部门）
	* Net suppliers of capital: purchase the securities issued by firms
* Governments （政府）
	* Can be both borrowers or lenders

#### Financial Intermediaries:
* to bring the suppliers of capital (investors) together with the demanders of capital
* Pool and invest funds the primary social function is to channel household savings to the business sector 

##### Players
* Commercial Banks
* Investment Companies
	* Mutual funds (共同基金）
		* pool and manage the money of many investors， who are assigned a prorated（按比例分配） share of the total funds according to the size of their investment
		* economies of scale (由规模经济决定）
		* large-scale trading and portfolio management 
		* for small  investors
	* Trust
		* design portfolios specifically for large investors with particular goals.
	* Investment Bank
		* Advice on how to price new securities (stocks ,bonds) 
		* Sell newly issued securities to public in the primary market 
		* Investors trade previously issued securities among themselves in the secondary markets
	* venture capital (VC, 风险投资）
		* Investments in Start-up companies: invest in them in return for an ownership stake in the firm
		* Source: venture capital funds, wealthy individuals known as angel investors, and institutions such as pension funds 
		* Venture capital investors commonly take an active role in the management of a start-up firm
	* Private equity(PE）
		* also invest in distressed firms, or merger & acquisition for restructuring firms
* Insurance companies
* Credit unions

## Basics of Investing Mechanism

### How Firms Issue Securities
• Primary Market
• Market for newly-issued securities
• Firms issue new securities through underwriter
(investment banker) to public
• Secondary Market
• Investors trade previously issued securities
among themselves


---

## Risk and Return

### Interest rate

* Equilibrium real rates are determined by demand for funds supply and demand of funds
	* The supply of funds from Households 
	* The demand for funds from Businesses 
	* Government can provide either net supply of or demand for funds
	* 就是 #经济学原理 里面的供给需求线的交汇
* Equilibrium nominal rate
	* investors should be concerned with real returns
	* When expected inflation rate is higher, nominal interest rates should be higher
	* This higher nominal rate is necessary to maintain the expected real return offered by an investment
* Fisher’s hypothesis
	* Nominal rate should increase one-for-one with increases in the expected inflation rate
	* $$r_{nom}=r_{real}+E(i)$$
	* difficult to test the hypothesis because the equilibrium real rate also changes unpredictably over time

#### some returns

* APR: auunal percentage return
	* simple compounding
	* T < 1 year
	* $$APR=r_f(T)\times (1/T)$$
* EAR: effective annual return
	* T > 1 year
	* $$1+EAR=[1+r_f(T)]^{1/T}$$
* HPR: holding period return
	* $$HPR=\frac{P_1-P_0+D_1}{P_0}$$

#### excess return

* Excess return: the difference between the actual rate of return on a risky asset and the actual risk-free rate
* Risk premium is the expected value of the excess return, 是期望
	* Risk is measured by standard deviation 
* Risk aversion
	* The degree to which investors are willing to commit funds to stocks

#### Time series analysis

* Estimated Expected Return through historical data
	* $$E(r)=\sum_{s=1}^Np(s)r(s)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{s=1}^Nr(s)$$
	* 把每个数据点等价加权
	* If the time series of historical returns fairly represents the true underlying probability distribution, then the arithmetic average return from a historical period provides a forecast of the investment’s expected future HPR
* The arithmetic average provides an unbiased estimate of the expected future return.
* Geometric (Time-Weighted) Average
	* $$g=TV^{1/n}-1, \text{where } TV_n=(1+r_1)(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)$$
	* $TV_n$ is the Terminal value of the investment
* 几何平均总小于算术平均
	* For normal distribution: $E(\text{Geometric average})=E(\text{Arithmetric average})-\sigma^2/2$
* Using historical data with n observations, we could estimate variance is
	* $$\hat{\sigma}^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{s=1}^n[r(s)-\bar{r}]^2$$

* **historical performance measure: geometric**
* **Forecast: arithmetic**


### Sharpe ratio

investments typically entail accepting some risk in return for the more excess return 
* If we are willing to face risk, then we can expect to earn a risk premium
* the trade-off between reward and risk

$$\color{red}{\text{Sharpe ratio}=\frac{\text{Risk premium}}{\text{SD of excess return}}}$$
* 通常来说，high risk high return

## Risk Aversion and Capital Allocation to Risky Assets

#### speculation vs. gamble

* speculation （投机）
	* Taking considerable risk for a commensurate gain
		* Reject a fair game
		* Only accept risk for risk premium 
		* Speculators are Rational
* gamble （赌博）
	* Bet on an uncertain outcome for enjoyment 
		* Accept a fair game or a negative value game
		* Do not requires risk premium for taking risks 
		* Gamblers are irrational, subject to behavioral bias

### risk aversion and utility

* Risk-averse Investors are speculators in capital markets
	* Investors invest in portfolios of assets
	* reject investment portfolios that are fair games or worse
* Risk aversion measures investor’s preference for risk
	* Different investors are different in risk aversion 
* assess the risk aversion level of an investor by his utility score
* Risk averse investors are willing to consider:
	* Risk-free assets
	* Speculative investments with positive risk premiums 
* Risk tolerance: inverse of risk aversion 


#### Mean variance utility

* A = coefficient of risk aversion
* $$U=E(r)-\frac{A}{2}\sigma^2$$
* Risk averse investor: A>0 
* Risk neutral investor: A=0 
* Risk lover investor （gambler） A<0

#### Certainty equivalent rate, CER

* 确定等价收益
	*  the rate that a risk-free investment an investor requires to provide the same utility as the risky investment
* An investment can be desirable only if its certainty equivalent return exceeds that of the risk-free
	* The difference is the risk premium

#### Indifference curve

![Indifference curve](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325175837.png)
* An investor’s  own indifference curves do not intersect
* Indifference curves of two investors might intersect 
* Indifference curves have positive slopes
* In a set of indifference curves, the highest offers the greatest utility

### Capital Allocation

* The choice among broad asset classes : stocks, bonds, cash 
* **The most fundamental decision in investments**
* The simplest way to control risk is to manipulate the fraction of the portfolio invested in risk-free assets versus in the risky assets

#### Capital Allocation Line （CAL） 

* Investment opportunity set formed with a risky asset and a risk-free asset
* 只有一个risky asset和risk-free asset之间
* ![CAL](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325180605.png)
* invertors 在这条线与Utility的切线点可以达到效用最大化
* optimal position in risky:
	* $$\color{red}{y^*=\frac{E(r_p)-r_f}{A\sigma_p^2}}$$

#### Passive strategies

* The passive strategy avoids any direct or indirect security analysis
* Supply and demand forces may make such a strategy a reasonable choice for many investors
* A natural candidate for a passively held risky asset would be a well-diversified portfolio of common stocks such as the S&P 500

##### Capital Market Line, CML

* a capital allocation line formed investment in two passive portfolios
	* Virtually risk-free short-term T-bills (or a money market fund) 
	* Fund of common stocks that mimics a broad market index
* 是由risk-free asset与market index连线

## MPT and CAPM

#### Diversification

portfolio可以分散公司的自有风险，不能分散公司的系统性风险

#### Portfolio of two risky assets

* 假设是debt和equity
* Portfolio return $$E(r)=w_DE(r_D)+w_EE(r_E)$$
* Portfolio Variance $$\sigma_p^2=w_D^2\sigma_D^2+w_E^2\sigma_E^2+2w_Dw_ECov(r_D,r_E)$$
* $$Cov(r_D,r_E)=\rho_{DE}\sigma_D\sigma_E$$
* 当相关系数为1时，没有任何风险被分散
* 当相关系数为-1时，可能构造出一个风险为0的组合，完全对冲风险

#### Global Minimum Variance Portfolio （MVP）

* The minimum variance portfolio is the portfolio composed of the risky assets that has the smallest standard deviation; the portfolio with least risk 
	* 当相关系数>0时，不可能减小风险
	* 当相关系数=0时，总风险可能比两个分别都小
	* 当相关系数<0时，可能构造出risk-free

#### portfolio return and variance

![Portfolio Expected Return vs Standard Deviation](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325200138.png)
* 这条线是Opportunity Set of risky assets

#### Determination of the optimal overall portfolio

![找到最佳组合](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325200631.png)

* Optimal portfolio selection for N risky assets and one risk free asset:
	* Efficient frontier: identify the risk–return combinations available from the set of risky assets
		* 找到所有risky asset组成的组合的可能性边界，不考虑risk-free asset
	* Security selection: Determination of the optimal risky portfolio 
		* 找Sharpe ratio最大的点，也就是切点
	* Capital allocation: Allocation of the complete portfolio to risk-free versus the risky portfolio depends on personal preference
		* 在这条切线上找与Utility相切点
