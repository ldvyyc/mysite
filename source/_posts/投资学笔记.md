## 基本目标

* Asset pricing: equity, bonds, derivatives
* Asset allocation
* Consumption timing
* Financial engineering

* AN INVESTMENT IS the current commitment of money or other resources in the expectation of reaping future benefits
* These investment decisions are made in a competitive environment where
	* higher returns usually can be obtained only at the price of greater risk
	* it is rare to find assets that are so mispriced as to be obvious bargains.


## Overview

* Financial assets
	* Claims on real assets
	* Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, bank deposits（银行存款）, investment accounts（投资账户）, and cash
* real assets generate net income to the economy 
* financial assets simply define the **allocation of income or wealth** among investors
	* 金融资产只是在投资者之间进行分配
* Financial assets are aggregated out and the total balance sheet for a country contains only real assets
* 金融资产流动性更高
* 金融资产更难定价

### 金融市场和经济

* informational role
	* 资金流向前景最好的公司
	* 与股价相关
* 投资时间
	* 通过securities将消费推迟到下个周期
* 分散风险
	* select securities consistent with their tastes for risk
	* the firms that need to raise capital as security can be sold for the best possible price
* Separation of Ownership and Management

#### Mechanisms to mitigate agency problems:

* Tie managers' income to the success of the firm （stock options）
* Monitoring from the board of directors
* Monitoring from the large outside investors and security analysts
* Takeover threat

### Investment Process

#### composition
* Portfolios
* Asset classes 
	* stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities,… 
* Asset Allocation
* The security selection
	* Investment choice of which particular securities to hold within each asset class
	* Security analysis: the valuation of particular securities

#### process

* “Top-down” approach
	* 先从资源配置出发，再具体到证券或股票
	* First step: Asset allocation
	* Second step: security selection 
* “Bottom-up” approach
	* Investment based solely on security  selection 
	* Disadvantage: may result in unintended heavy weight of a portfolio in only one or another sector of the economy
	* Advantage: focus the portfolio on the assets that seem to offer the most attractive investment opportunities

### Competitive Market

no “free lunches” 

* $\color{red}{\text{Risk-Return Trade-Off}}$
	* If you want higher expected returns, you will have to pay a price by accepting higher risk
* Diversification
	* When we mix assets into diversified portfolios, we need to consider the interplay among assets and the effect of diversification on the risk of the entire portfolio\
* 有效市场假说
	* In fully efficient markets when prices quickly adjust to all relevant information, there should be neither underpriced nor overpriced securities

* Passive Management（被动投资）
	* 接受市场大盘
	* Holding a highly diversified portfolio（分散投资）
	* No attempt to find undervalued securities
	* No attempt to time the market
* Active Management（主动投资）
	* Finding mispriced securities（选股）
	* Timing the market（择时）

### Players

* Demanders of capital – Firms（企业部门） 
	* Net borrowers of fund: raise capital to pay for investments in plant and equipment
	* income generated by those real assets provides the returns to investors who purchase the securities issued by the firm.
* Suppliers of capital – Households（住户部门）
	* Net suppliers of capital: purchase the securities issued by firms
* Governments （政府）
	* Can be both borrowers or lenders

#### Financial Intermediaries:
* to bring the suppliers of capital (investors) together with the demanders of capital
* Pool and invest funds the primary social function is to channel household savings to the business sector 

##### Players
* Commercial Banks
* Investment Companies
	* Mutual funds (共同基金）
		* pool and manage the money of many investors， who are assigned a prorated（按比例分配） share of the total funds according to the size of their investment
		* economies of scale (由规模经济决定）
		* large-scale trading and portfolio management 
		* for small  investors
	* Trust
		* design portfolios specifically for large investors with particular goals.
	* Investment Bank
		* Advice on how to price new securities (stocks ,bonds) 
		* Sell newly issued securities to public in the primary market 
		* Investors trade previously issued securities among themselves in the secondary markets
	* venture capital (VC, 风险投资）
		* Investments in Start-up companies: invest in them in return for an ownership stake in the firm
		* Source: venture capital funds, wealthy individuals known as angel investors, and institutions such as pension funds 
		* Venture capital investors commonly take an active role in the management of a start-up firm
	* Private equity(PE）
		* also invest in distressed firms, or merger & acquisition for restructuring firms
* Insurance companies
* Credit unions

## Basics of Investing Mechanism

### How Firms Issue Securities

* Primary Market
	* Market for newly-issued securities
	* Firms issue new securities through underwriter （investment banker） to public
* Secondary Market
	* Investors trade previously issued securities among themselves
* Companies
	* Privately Held Firms
		* Up to 499 shareholders 
		* Raise funds through private placement 
		* Lower liquidity of shares 
		* Have fewer obligations to release financial statements and other information
	* Publicly Traded Companies
		* Raise capital from a wider range of investors through initial public offering, IPO
			* Seasoned equity offering: The sale of additional shares in firms that already are publicly traded 
		* Public offerings are marketed by investment bankers or underwriters 
		* Registration must be filed with the Security regulators （eg SEC, CSRC）
* ![issue securities](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230326151031.png)

##### 中国股票发行制度及改革
* 审批制（examination and approval,1991-2000）
	* 采用行政和计划的办法分配股票发行的指标和额度
* 核准制（approval, 2001-2020）
	* 取消了指标和额度管理 
	* 证券中介机构：发行是否符合市场条件 
	* 证券监管机构：发行是否符合监管条件
* 注册制（registration, 2020-）
	* 市场化发行制度：发行公司股票的规模和定价由市场判断 
	* 注册制注重信息披露：对申报文件的全面性、准确性、真实性和及时性作形式审查 
	* 23年，全面注册制

##### IPO, initial public offering

* （under registration system）
	* File prospectus to security regulator
	* Road shows to publicize new offering
	* Determine demand for the new issue （Bookbuilding） 
	* Degree of investor interest in the new offering provides valuable pricing information
* Underwriter bears price risk associated with placement of securities:
	* IPOs are commonly underpriced compared to the price they could be marketed （IPO discount）
	* Some IPOs are well overpriced others cannot even fully be sold

### How securities are traded

* Types of Markets: 
	* Direct search
		* Buyers and sellers seek each other 
	* Brokered markets
		* Brokers search out buyers and sellers 
	* Dealer markets
		* Dealers have inventories of assets from which they buy and sell 
		* 注意broker和dealer的区别
		* Bid-ask spread is the profit for a dealer
	* Auction markets
		* Traders converge at one place to trade
* Types of Orders
	* Market orders
		* 直接交易，按照市场价
	* Price-contingent Order
		* Traders specify buying or selling price
		* 包括：Limit-Buy Order, Stop-Buy Order, Limit-Sell Order, Stop-Loss Order

#### Trading Mechanisms

* Dealer markets 
* Electronic communication networks （ECNs）
	* True trading systems that can automatically execute orders 
* Specialists markets
	* Maintain a “fair and orderly market” 
	* Have been largely replaced by ECNs

* New trading strategies
	* Algorithmic Trading
		* The use of computer programs to make trading decisions 
	* High-Frequency Trading
		* Special class of algorithmic with very short order execution time
	* Dark Pools
	* Trading venues that preserve anonymity, mainly relevant in block trading

* Bond Trading
	* Most bond trading takes place in the OTC market among bond dealers 
	* NYSE Bonds is the largest centralized bond market of any U.S. exchange 
	* Market for many bond issues is “thin” and is subject to liquidity risk

#### Trading Costs

* Brokerage Commission: 
	* Fee paid to broker for making the transaction
* Explicit cost of trading 
	* Spread: Difference between the bid and asked prices 
* Implicit cost of trading
	* the price concession an investor may be forced to make for trading in quantities greater than those associated with the posted bid or ask price
	* 例如，买一50手，卖一30手，卖二20手，不能只买卖一的。

#### Brokerage account

* Cash account 现金账户
	* A brokerage account in which all transactions are made on a strictly cash basis. 
* Margin account 信用账户（融资融券）
	* A brokerage account in which securities can be bought and sold on credit.

#### Margin（保证金） 
* The portion of the value of an investment that is not borrowed in a margin purchase
	* Margin rate = Equity/Value of investment 
* The portion that is borrowed incurs an interest
	* This interest is set by brokers
	* determined by the rate brokers pay to borrow money plus a service charge charge
* Initial Margin 初始保证金
	* the minimum margin requirement when you first purchase securities on margin 
	* Currently 50% for stocks; you can borrow up to 50% of the stock value
* Maintenance Margin 维持保证金
	* the minimum margin that you must need to maintain in a margin account after your initial purchase.
* Margin Call
	* When the margin drops below the maintenance margin, the broker issues a margin call. 
	* It requires the investor to bring the margin back up to an acceptable level （most of the time the initial margin level）
		* add new cash or securities, pay off the loan, or sell enough current securities 
		* If investors do not act, the broker has the right to sell securities from the account.
* Margin is a Financial Leverage
	* **the impact is to magnify both your gains and your losses**

#### Short sale

* After short sales, the investor have a short position
* an investor who buys and owns shares of stock is said to be long in the stock or to have a long position.
* For short position, sell high buy low
* For long position, buy low sell high

* Risks
	* Long position in stocks:
		* Upside return (unlimited)
		* Downside losses (limited: -100%) 
	* Short selling stocks:
		* Upside return (limited: +100%)
			* 股价最低到0，而且几乎不可能达到
		* Downside losses (unlimited)
			* 股价升值

#### Short sale mechanisms

* Proceeds from the short sale must be kept on account with the broker 
* the short seller does not earn interest on the short proceeds and cannot use the proceeds for another transaction 
* If any dividends are paid on the stock while you have a short position, you must pay them. 
	* 分红必须返还
* A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned.
* At any time, the security lender may call for the return of his shares
	* The security borrower (short seller) must buy shares on the market and return them to the lender (or he must borrow the shares from elsewhere).
	* 只要lender想要，必须返还

##### Short Sqeeze 挤兑

* A short squeeze
	* heavily shorted security moves sharply higher, forcing short sellers to close out their short positions and adding to the upward pressure on the stock.
	* 知道卖空的人多，故意抬高价格
	* Short sellers are being squeezed out of their short positions 

##### Impact of short selling on financial market

* Pros
	* Enhance the liquidity and efficiency of the market. 
	* Help security price discovery: exploits market mistakes about firms' fundamentals. Curb "pump and dump”. 
	* Uncover fraudulent accounting and other problems at companies
* Cons
	* Abusive short selling can be used for market manipulation:
		* aggressively driving down a stock price through heavy short selling, then buying the shares for a large profit 
	* Lead to the undesired market volatility

##### Short selling for investors

* Pros
	* Some investors are better at identifying overpriced, bad companies than underpriced, good companies. 
		* 相当于long position的反向
	* Many institutions won't do short selling, leaving unexploited short selling opportunities from which you can benefit.
	* Hedging. A portfolio including both long and short positions in stocks which tend to move together will generally have lower volatility than one which has only long positions.
		* 对冲风险
* Cons
	* There's unlimited downside potential and limited upside potential. 
	* You're fighting the trend of the market, which is, in the long run, up. 
	* Money from a short sale is used as collateral for the owner of the borrowed shares. You aren't earning interest on the proceeds from short sales. 
	* You have to pay any dividends that are earned. 
	* Another company could acquire the company you're shorting, at a significant premium, thus driving up the share price.
	* Sometimes shares aren't available to short. 
	* The obligation to buy and return the shares whenever the lender call for the return of his shares

## Risk and Return

### Interest rate

* Equilibrium real rates are determined by demand for funds supply and demand of funds
	* The supply of funds from Households 
	* The demand for funds from Businesses 
	* Government can provide either net supply of or demand for funds
	* 就是 #经济学原理 里面的供给需求线的交汇
* Equilibrium nominal rate
	* investors should be concerned with real returns
	* When expected inflation rate is higher, nominal interest rates should be higher
	* This higher nominal rate is necessary to maintain the expected real return offered by an investment
* Fisher’s hypothesis
	* Nominal rate should increase one-for-one with increases in the expected inflation rate
	* $$r_{nom}=r_{real}+E(i)$$
	* difficult to test the hypothesis because the equilibrium real rate also changes unpredictably over time

#### some returns

* APR: auunal percentage return
	* simple compounding
	* T < 1 year
	* $$APR=r_f(T)\times (1/T)$$
* EAR: effective annual return
	* T > 1 year
	* $$1+EAR=[1+r_f(T)]^{1/T}$$
* HPR: holding period return
	* $$HPR=\frac{P_1-P_0+D_1}{P_0}$$

#### excess return

* Excess return: the difference between the actual rate of return on a risky asset and the actual risk-free rate
* Risk premium is the expected value of the excess return, 是期望
	* Risk is measured by standard deviation 
* Risk aversion
	* The degree to which investors are willing to commit funds to stocks

#### Time series analysis

* Estimated Expected Return through historical data
	* $$E(r)=\sum_{s=1}^Np(s)r(s)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{s=1}^Nr(s)$$
	* 把每个数据点等价加权
	* If the time series of historical returns fairly represents the true underlying probability distribution, then the arithmetic average return from a historical period provides a forecast of the investment’s expected future HPR
* The arithmetic average provides an unbiased estimate of the expected future return.
* Geometric (Time-Weighted) Average
	* $$g=TV^{1/n}-1, \text{where } TV_n=(1+r_1)(1+r_2)...(1+r_n)$$
	* $TV_n$ is the Terminal value of the investment
* 几何平均总小于算术平均
	* For normal distribution: $E(\text{Geometric average})=E(\text{Arithmetric average})-\sigma^2/2$
* Using historical data with n observations, we could estimate variance is
	* $$\hat{\sigma}^2=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{s=1}^n[r(s)-\bar{r}]^2$$

* **historical performance measure: geometric**
* **Forecast: arithmetic**


### Sharpe ratio

investments typically entail accepting some risk in return for the more excess return 
* If we are willing to face risk, then we can expect to earn a risk premium
* the trade-off between reward and risk

$$\color{red}{\text{Sharpe ratio}=\frac{\text{Risk premium}}{\text{SD of excess return}}}$$
* 通常来说，high risk high return

---

## Risk Aversion and Capital Allocation to Risky Assets

#### speculation vs. gamble

* speculation （投机）
	* Taking considerable risk for a commensurate gain
		* Reject a fair game
		* Only accept risk for risk premium 
		* Speculators are Rational
* gamble （赌博）
	* Bet on an uncertain outcome for enjoyment 
		* Accept a fair game or a negative value game
		* Do not requires risk premium for taking risks 
		* Gamblers are irrational, subject to behavioral bias

### risk aversion and utility

* Risk-averse Investors are speculators in capital markets
	* Investors invest in portfolios of assets
	* reject investment portfolios that are fair games or worse
* Risk aversion measures investor’s preference for risk
	* Different investors are different in risk aversion 
* assess the risk aversion level of an investor by his utility score
* Risk averse investors are willing to consider:
	* Risk-free assets
	* Speculative investments with positive risk premiums 
* Risk tolerance: inverse of risk aversion 


#### Mean variance utility

* A = coefficient of risk aversion
* $$U=E(r)-\frac{A}{2}\sigma^2$$
* Risk averse investor: A>0 
* Risk neutral investor: A=0 
* Risk lover investor （gambler） A<0

#### Certainty equivalent rate, CER

* 确定等价收益
	*  the rate that a risk-free investment an investor requires to provide the same utility as the risky investment
* An investment can be desirable only if its certainty equivalent return exceeds that of the risk-free
	* The difference is the risk premium

#### Indifference curve

![Indifference curve](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325175837.png)
* An investor’s  own indifference curves do not intersect
* Indifference curves of two investors might intersect 
* Indifference curves have positive slopes
* In a set of indifference curves, the highest offers the greatest utility

### Capital Allocation

* The choice among broad asset classes : stocks, bonds, cash 
* **The most fundamental decision in investments**
* The simplest way to control risk is to manipulate the fraction of the portfolio invested in risk-free assets versus in the risky assets

#### Capital Allocation Line （CAL） 

* Investment opportunity set formed with a risky asset and a risk-free asset
* 只有一个risky asset和risk-free asset之间
* ![CAL](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325180605.png)
* invertors 在这条线与Utility的切线点可以达到效用最大化
* optimal position in risky:
	* $$\color{red}{y^*=\frac{E(r_p)-r_f}{A\sigma_p^2}}$$

#### Passive strategies

* The passive strategy avoids any direct or indirect security analysis
* Supply and demand forces may make such a strategy a reasonable choice for many investors
* A natural candidate for a passively held risky asset would be a well-diversified portfolio of common stocks such as the S&P 500

##### Capital Market Line, CML

* a capital allocation line formed investment in two passive portfolios
	* Virtually risk-free short-term T-bills (or a money market fund) 
	* Fund of common stocks that mimics a broad market index
* 是由risk-free asset与market index连线

## MPT and CAPM

#### Diversification

portfolio可以分散公司的自有风险，不能分散公司的系统性风险

#### Portfolio of two risky assets

* 假设是debt和equity
* Portfolio return $$E(r)=w_DE(r_D)+w_EE(r_E)$$
* Portfolio Variance $$\sigma_p^2=w_D^2\sigma_D^2+w_E^2\sigma_E^2+2w_Dw_ECov(r_D,r_E)$$
* $$Cov(r_D,r_E)=\rho_{DE}\sigma_D\sigma_E$$
* 当相关系数为1时，没有任何风险被分散
* 当相关系数为-1时，可能构造出一个风险为0的组合，完全对冲风险

#### Global Minimum Variance Portfolio （MVP）

* The minimum variance portfolio is the portfolio composed of the risky assets that has the smallest standard deviation; the portfolio with least risk 
	* 当相关系数>0时，不可能减小风险
	* 当相关系数=0时，总风险可能比两个分别都小
	* 当相关系数<0时，可能构造出risk-free

![Portfolio Expected Return vs Standard Deviation](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325200138.png)
* 这条线是Opportunity Set of risky assets

#### Determination of the optimal overall portfolio

![找到最佳组合](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325200631.png)

* Optimal portfolio selection for N risky assets and one risk free asset:
	* Efficient frontier: identify the risk–return combinations available from the set of risky assets
		* 找到所有risky asset组成的组合的可能性边界，不考虑risk-free asset
	* Security selection: Determination of the optimal risky portfolio 
		* 找Sharpe ratio最大的点，也就是切点
	* Capital allocation: Allocation of the complete portfolio to risk-free versus the risky portfolio depends on personal preference
		* 在这条切线上找与Utility相切点

![Efficient frontier](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325201320.png)


#### Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Model 

* Method 1
	* $$\sigma_p^2=\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^Nw_iw_jCov(r_i,r_j)$$
	* $$min_{w_i}\sigma_p^2 \quad\text{, so that } \quad E(r_p)=\sum_{i=1}^Nw_ir_i=R$$
* Method 2
	* $$max_{w_i}S_p=\frac{E(r_p)-r_f}{\sigma_p} \quad \text{subject to } \quad \sum w_i=1$$

* CAL: introduce the risk-free asset

#### Separation Principle

* **Everyone invests in P, regardless of their degree of risk aversion** 
	* More risk averse investors put more in the risk-free asset

### Assumptions

* Investor behavior
	* Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers.
	* Their investment horizon is a single period 
	* Investors use identical input list for efficient frontier (homogeneous expectation)
* Market structure
	* All assets are publicly held and trade on public exchanges
	* Investors can borrow or lend at a common risk-free rate, and they can take short positions on traded securities
	* No taxes
	* No transaction costs

#### Market portfolio

![CML](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230325204906.png)


### Equilibrium Conditions

* Each investor’s risky portfolio holding is
	* $$y=\frac{E(r_m)-r_f}{A\sigma_m^2}$$
* We aggregate all investors together, In equilibrium, all borrowing and lending cancelled
	* Assume average investor’s risk averse $\bar{A}$
	* y = 1
	* thus, $E(R_m)=\bar{A}\sigma_m^2$
* portfolio risk
	* $$\sigma_p^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^nw_iw_jCov(r_i,r_j)$$
* market portfolio risk:
	* $$\sigma_p^2=\sum_{i=1}^Nw_iCov(r_i,\sum_{j=1}^Nw_jr_j)$$
	* $$\sigma_m^2=\sum_{i=1}^Nw_iCov(r_i,r_m)$$
	* 每只stock对整体风险的贡献是这只股票与市场的Cov，不是自己的Variance

* $$\frac{E(r_m)-r_f}{\sigma_m^2}=\frac{E(r_i)-r_f}{Cov(r_i,r_m)}$$
* $$\text{Since  }\beta_i=\frac{Cov(r_i,r_m)}{\sigma_m^2}\text{ , thus }\quad \color{red}{E(r_i)-r_f=\beta_i(E(r_m)-r_f)}$$
* this is CAPM.


#### Security Market Line, SML

![SML with a positive alpha](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230326161453.png)


### CAPM Application and Limitation 
* CAPM holds for the overall portfolio
* Application: Provide a benchmark model for risk premium
	* Application in corporate finance
	* Cost of capital
	* IPO pricing
* Limitation: CAPM only accounts for market risk
	* Systematic risk other than market risk such as Non-tradable risk, Liquidity risk, inflation, interest rate ...

## Index Model

* Problems with Markovitz model
	* The covariance matrix is too large to be estimated accurately
		* For example, the covariance of n=50 stocks consists of $(n^2 –n)/2=1325$ estimations 
		* Inconsistent estimation of correlation matrix 

* Factor Model
	* The actual rate of return on any security 
		* $r_i=E(r_i)+\text{unanticipated surprise}$

### Single factor model

* Single factor model: decompose risk （the unanticipated surprise） into
	* A systematic risk factor （denoted as m）
	* Firm specific risk（denoted as $e_i$）
	* Covariance between stocks are due to their covariance with systematic risk factor m
* $$\color{red}{r_i=E(r_i)+\beta_im+e_i}$$
	* $$E(m)=0,E(e_i)=0$$
	* m 和 $e_i$ 是独立的
	* $E(r_i)$ 无方差
	* $\beta_i$, the sensitivity for firm i
	* the total variance of $r_i$ is
		* $$\sigma_i^2=\beta_i^2\sigma_m^2+\sigma^2(e_i)$$
	* Cov between two firm's return is 
		* $$Cov(r_i,r_j)=Cov(\beta_im+e_i,\beta_jm+e_j)=\beta_i\beta_j\sigma_m^2$$
	* 当n很大时，firm-specific risk被消去了，只剩系统风险

#### single index model

* When single factor is a market index （or generally well-diversified portfolio）
* Security characteristic line
	* $$R_i(t)=\alpha_i+\beta_iR_m(t)+e_i$$
	* ![Security Characteristic Line](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230326162444.png)
* Expected Return–Beta Relationship
	* $$E(R_i)=\alpha_i+\beta_iE(R_m)$$
	* $$\color{red}{R-square=\frac{\beta_i^2\sigma_m^2}{\beta_i^2\sigma_m^2+\sigma^2(e_i)}}$$

* Single index model: a framework that separates macroeconomic and security analysis
	* Macroeconomic analysis : estimate the risk premium and risk of the market index. 
	* Statistical analysis : estimate the beta coefficients of all securities and their residual variances, $\sigma^2(e_i)$. 
	* Asset pricing model: The portfolio manager uses the estimates for the market-index risk premium and the beta coefficient of a security to establish the expected return of that security 
	* Security analysis:  expected return forecasts （alphas） are derived from various security-valuation models


#### Alpha

* Alpha（α） is a nonmarket premium （abnormal return）
	* Depends on factor model
	* α may be large if you think a security is underpriced and therefore offers an attractive expected return
	* CAPM （or other competitive equilibrium model） predicts α will be zero
	* Security analysis: each security analyst comes up with his or her own estimates of alpha
	* A portfolio manager who has no special information about a security nor insight unavailable to the general public will take the security’s alpha value as zero
* alpha is the key variable that tells us whether a security is a good or a bad buy 
	* A positive-alpha security is a bargain and therefore should be over-weighted 

#### The Industry Version of the Index Model

* Adjusted beta
	* $\text{Adjusted beta}=\frac{2}{3}\text{estimated beta}+\frac{1}{3}$
	* Why adjusted beta
		* empirically, beta coefficients seem to move toward 1 over time 
		* statistically, the average beta over all securities is 1. Before estimating the beta of a security, our best forecast would be that it is 1.
* Predicting beta
	* One simple approach would be to collect data on beta in different periods and then estimate a regression equation
		* $\text{current beta}=a+b\times (\text{past beta})$
	* Different predicting variables
		* $\text{current beta}=a+b_1\times (\text{past beta})+b_2\times (\text{firm size})+b_3\times (\text{debt ratio})$

#### Portfolio construction and the single index model

* A simple way to achieve diversification: include the S&P 500 index portfolio as one of the assets of the portfolio
* Passive portfolio: If no security, portfolio manager(PM) would hold the S&P 500 as a passive portfolio
	* It gives broad market exposure without the need for expensive security analysis
* Active portfolio: With security analysis, the PM may be able to devise an active portfolio that can be mixed with the index to provide a better risk–return trade-off
* Under single index model, the optimal portfolio can be derived explicitly, consisting of
	* an active portfolio（A） comprised of the n analyzed securities
	* the market index portfolio, the （n + 1）th asset （passive portfolio ,M）

##### 构造方法

1. 计算各个股票的权重为 $w_i^0=\alpha_i/\sigma^2(e_i)$
2. 归一化 $w_i=w_i^0/(\sum w_i^0)$
3. 计算active portfolio的α $\alpha_A=\sum w_i\alpha_i$
4. 计算active portfolio的残差 $\sigma^2(e_A)=\sum w_i^2\sigma^2(e_i)$
5. 计算active portfolio的初始权重 $w_A^0=(\alpha_A/\sigma^2(e^A))/(E(R_M)/\sigma^2M)$
6. 计算active portfolio的beta $\beta_A=\sum w_i\beta_i$
7. 调整初始权重 $w_A^*=w_A^0/(1+(1-\beta_A)w_A^0)$
8. 组合的权重为 $w_M^*=1-w_A^*\quad w_i^*=w_A^*w_i$

* 相关数据：
	* $$E(R_p)=(w_M^*+w_A^*\beta_A)E(R_M)+w_A^*\alpha_A$$
	* $$\sigma^2_P=(w_M^*+w_A^*\beta_A)^2\sigma_M^2+(w_A^*\sigma(e_A))^2$$
	* $$\color{red}{S_p^2=S_M^2+(\frac{\alpha_A}{\sigma(e_A)})^2}$$
	* 其中 $(\frac{\alpha_A}{\sigma(e_A)})^2$ 是 information rato
		* measures the extra return we can obtain from security analysis compared to the firm-specific risk 
		* the information ratio if optimized, is always increasing with increasing number of active security 
		* if a security’s alpha is negative, the security will assume a short position in the optimal risky portfolio

* **The index portfolio is an efficient portfolio only if all alpha values are zero  from security analysis**

## CAPM, Multifactor model and APT

### Single factor model 

* $$R_i=E(R_i)+\beta_iF+e_i$$
	* $R_i$ is excess return on security
	* $F$ is Surprise in macro-economic factor
		* F could be positive or negative but has expected value of zero
	* $\beta_i$ Factor sensitivity or factor loading or factor beta 
	* $e_i$ Firm specific events （zero expected value）

#### index model and CAPM

* CAPM indicates $\alpha_i$ is 0
* $E(R_i)=\beta_iE(R_m)$
* assets should be on the security market line （SML）

### CAPM

* **The assumptions of the CAPM**
	* **Single period investment （vs intertemporal risk premium fluctuation）**
	* **investors face the same opportunity set**
	* **No frictions**
	* **All assets are traded: no untradable asset risk**
	* **All investors are rational mean-variance optimizers with homogeneous expectations**
* Systematic Risk beyond CAPM 
	* Inflation risk
		* Uncertainty due to inflation rate
	* Interest rate risk (Real)
	* Volatility risk
	* Liquidity risk
		* Price risk due to transaction costs/trading friction 
	* Untradable asset risk
		* labor income risk(unemployment risk)
		* entrepreneurial risk
		* housing price risk 
	* For long horizon investors, concerns about future risk premium changes over economic cycle
		* Macro economic factors

### Multifactor model

* Possible common macro-economic factors
	* Business cycle （GDP Growth）
	* Interest Rates 
	* Inflation Rates 
	* Liquidity
* Possible factors due to extra risk premium
	* size 
	* Value
	* Many firm characteristics seem to predict future returns （active current research area）

 * Example
	 * $$R_i=E(R_i)+\beta_{iGDP}GDP+\beta_{iIR}IR+e_i$$
	 * $$E(R_i)=\beta_{iGDP}RP_{GDP}+\beta_{iIR}RP_{IR}$$
		 * RP stands for risk premium
* multifactor model
	* Multiple risk exposures, each risk factor has its own risk premium 
	* Estimate a beta or factor loading for each factor using multiple regression
		* $$R_it=\sum_{j=1}^k\beta_{ij}F_j+\epsilon_{it}$$
* APT 
	* Multifactor version of security market line
	* $$E(R_i)=\sum_{j=1}^k\beta_{ij}E(R_j^F)$$

#### well-diversified portfolio

* if a portfolio is well diversified, its firm-specific or nonfactor risk becomes negligible
* ![well-diversified](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230326170753.png)![Non-diversified](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ldvyyc/ImgBed/20230326170922.png)

### APT（Arbitrage Pricing Theory）

* The Law of One Price : 
	* if two assets are equivalent in all respects, they should have the same market price
* Risk free arbitrage （a very strong assumption）:
	* any investor will want to take an infinite position in it 
* no-arbitrage condition:
	* rules out the existence of arbitrage opportunities
* In deriving APT, we assume risk-free arbitrage

* Arbitrage pricing theory for any well-diversified portfolio:
* $$\color{red}{E(r_i)=r_f+\beta_{i1}[E(r_1)-r_f]+\beta_{i2}[E(r_2)-r_f]}$$
* Can be extended to multifactor model
* **if this equation is to be satisfied by all well-diversified portfolios, it must be satisfied by almost all individual securities**



#### The Security Market Line of the APT 
* Security market line for well-diversified portfolios
	* $$E(R_P)=\beta_PE(R_F)$$

#### APT vs. CAPM

| APT                                                  | CAPM                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using any systematic risk factor                     | Model is based on an inherently unobservable "market" portfolio                                |
| Does not assume investors as mean-variance investors | rest on mean-variance efficiency. The actions of many small investors restore CAPM equilibrium |
| Apply to well-diversified portfolio                  | Apply to all assets                                                                            |

### Fama-French Three-Factor Model

* Size anomaly
	* the market value of outstanding equity
	* firms with small size outperforms large ones after accounting for CAPM market risk
* Value anomaly
	* book value per share divided by stock price
	* Firms with high book to market ratios outperforms lower ones
* Factors constructed based on the size and value anomaly
	* SMB = Small Minus Big （firm size）
	* HML = High Minus Low （book-to-market ratio）
* $$R_{it}=\alpha_i+\beta_{iSMB}SMB_t+\beta_{iHML}HML_t+\beta_{iM}R_{Mt}+e_{it}$$
* While SMB and HML are not themselves obvious candidates for relevant risk factors
	* may proxy for hard-to-measure more fundamental variables 
	* firms with high book-to-market ratios are more likely to be in financial distress
	* small stocks may be more sensitive to changes in business conditions

## Efficient Market Hypothesis

* 1953年 Maurice Kendall 发现股价的波动时随机游走的。该怎么解释？

### EMH
* Efficient Market
	* Market prices reflect all relevant information at a given time
* New information is unpredictable
	* if it could be predicted, then the prediction would be part of today’s information.
* Stock prices that change in response to new （unpredictable） information also must move unpredictably.
	* Stock price should follow a random walk if market is efficient
	* Efficient market ≠ perfect foresight market（无未知信息）

##### implication1

* EMH implies that there are no undervalued or overvalued financial assets
	* A forecast about favorable future performance leads to favorable current performance, as market participants rush to trade on new information.
	* Result: Prices change until expected returns are exactly commensurate with risk.
	* the price is “right”
	
#### reasons

* 为什么市场是有效的
	* driving force：competition and profit-motive
	* 当基数很大时很小的 $\alpha$ 也能产生很高的收益
	* 导致大基金公司倾向于寻找relevant information
* 为什么百分百有效不可能
	* 只有当寻找信息的投入likely to 产生超额收益时才会愿意去投入时间和精力
	* 在市场均衡时，有效的信息收集活动应当被奖励
	* the degree of efficiency differs across various markets, depending on the information environment

#### Information Set for Market efficiency

* Strong-form efficiency: all information of any kind, public or private, are available
* Semistrong form efficiency: all publicly available information
* Weak form efficiency: past price and volume

### EMH Implications 2

##### Technical analysis

* search for recurrent and predictable patterns in stock price
* **Weak form efficiency implies technical analysis is useless**
* Rationale
	* a sluggish response of stock prices to fundamental supply and demand factors
	* if the stock price responds slowly enough, the analyst will be able to identify a trend that can be exploited

##### Fundamental analysis

* using economic and accounting information to predict stock prices
	* Study past earnings and balance sheets information 
	* detailed economic analysis （including the quality of the firm’s management, the firm’s standing within its industry, the prospects for the industry, etc）
* **Semi-strong form EMH implies Fundamental Analysis is useless**

##### Information analysis

* whether the information you obtained is already priced in the market?
* Whether the information source is trust worthy?
* How the information is processed?

##### inspiration

* try to find firms better than everyone's estimates
* try to find poorly runned firms that are not that bad

##### Active and passive portfolios

* Active Management
	* An expensive strategy
	* Suitable only for very large portfolios
* Passive Management: No attempt to outsmart the market
	* Accept EMH
	* Index Funds and ETFs
	* Very low costs 
* 据统计，基金经理平均水平没有跑过大盘

##### Event study

* If security prices reflect all currently available information, then price changes must reflect new information
* 因此，measure the importance of an event by examining price changes during the period in which the event occurs
* Event study（短期事件分析）
	* Method
		* a technique to assess the impact of a particular event on a firm’s stock price
		* If market is efficient, the event should not impact price before or after the announcement of the event
		* Choose a time window （usually 10 days） around the event date to account for the information leakage and possible sluggish reactions
	* Key issue: Isolating the part of a stock price movement that is attributable to a specific event 
		* Use of a “market model” to approximate for all other information impact on the stock return
		* 也就是单因子模型寻找 $e_t$
	* **cumulative abnormal return （CAR）**, the sum of all abnormal returns over the time period
	* application
		*  the Regulators use event studies to measure illicit gains captured by traders who may have violated insider trading or other securities laws 
		* Event studies are also used in fraud cases, where the courts must assess damages caused by a fraudulent activity.

### Test EMH

#### statistical issues

* Magnitude Issue
	* Only managers of large portfolios can earn enough trading profits to make the exploitation of minor mispricing worth the effort.
* Selection Bias Issue
	* Only unsuccessful investment schemes are made public
	* good schemes remain private.
* Lucky Event Issue

#### 金融市场异常

* Anomaly is defined to be a deviation from a the CAPM （or other benchmark model）
* Return patterns that are unexplained by the CAPM are considered to be anomalous. 
* Usually a significantly positive intercept （正的 $\alpha$）

#### Weak-form test （弱式检验）

* Returns over the Short Horizon
	* Momentum
		*  Good or bad recent performance continues over short to intermediate time horizons
* Returns over Long Horizons
	* negative long-term serial correlation in the stock return performance
* Behavioral explanation
	* Episodes of overshooting followed by correction 
	* Overreaction  leads to positive serial correlation （momentum） over short time horizons 
	* Subsequent correction of the overreaction leads to negative serial correlation over longer horizons 
	* stock price fluctuates around its fair value

#### Semistrong form test

* Size effect: small-firm effect
	* higher average returns on small stocks than large stocks. Beta cannot explain the difference.
* Value effect: book-to-market ratios
	* higher average returns on value stocks than growth stocks. Beta cannot explain the difference.
	* Value firms: Firms with high B/M, E/P, D/P, B/P, or CF/P. The notion of value is that physical assets can be purchased at low market prices.
	* Growth firms: Firms with low above ratios. The notion is that high price relative to fundamentals reflects uncapitalized growth opportunities, or real options 
* Post-Earnings Announcement Price Drift
	* earnings surprise
		* Difference between actual earning and market expectations of earning 
		* Market expectations of earnings: measured by averaging the published earnings forecasts of analysts or by applying trend analysis to past earnings（一致预期）
	* EMH suggets response to announcement should be quick
		* For earnings announcement, positive (negative) surprise should lead to immediate positive (negative) stock returns
		* Many studies find market price responses to earnings announcements are slow

#### Strong form test

* Inside Information
* 不会预期市场强有效，因为
	* trading on inside information is illegal
	* Security regulators （SEC or CSRC） require all insiders to register their trading activity

#### Explanations of anomalies

* rational explanations
	* Fama French: explained by risk premiums
	* Measuring abnormal performance: rely on a specific asset pricing model
	* joint hypothesis problem: is it alpha or beta
	* distinguish luck from skill
* Behavioral explanations
	* evidence of inefficient markets
	* irrational investors

#### Mutual fund performance

* The conventional performance benchmark today is a four-factor model, which employs:
	* the three Fama-French factors
		* the return on the market index, and returns to portfolios based on size and book-to-market ratio
		* SMB，HML，$R_m-R_f$
* plus a momentum factor （a portfolio constructed based on prior-year stock return）

## Bonds

#见投资学与固定收益证券分析

一些要点：

* The bond price curve is convex 
* The longer the maturity, the more sensitive the bond’s price to changes in market interest rates 
* Current Yield
	* Bond’s annual coupon payment divided by the bond price
* For premium bonds （bond price above par value）
	* Coupon rate > Current yield > YTM
* Altman’s z-score model for bankruptcy prediction
	* $$Z=3.1\frac{EBIT}{\text{Total Assets}}+1.0\frac{Sales}{Assets}+.42\frac{\text{Shareholders Equity}}{Total Liability}+ .85\frac{\text{Retained Earnings}}{\text{Total Assets}}+.72\frac{\text{Working Capital}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$
	* Z < 1.23 , 有风险
	* 1.23 < Z < 2.9 , 灰色区域
	* Z > 2.9 , 安全
* Default yield spread
	* The difference between the promised YTM and the expected YTM

##### yield curve

* Investors require a liquidity premium （or risk premium） to hold a longer-term bond
	* $f_n$ generally exceeds $E(r_n)$ 
	* The excess of $f_n$ over $E(r_n)$ is the liquidity premium （or term risk premium, or simply risk premium）
	* The yield curve has an upward bias built into the long-term rates because of the risk premium
* An upward sloping curve could indicate:
	* Rates are expected to rise （Expectation hypothesis） 
	* and/or
	* Investors require large term risk premiums to hold long term bonds （liquidity preference/Risk premium theory）
* Inverted yield curve indicate that interest rates are expected to fall and signal a recession

## Equity Valuation Models

感觉和 #公司金融 讲的又很像，简单写一下对照着看看吧。

### Methods of Valuation

* Market value of equity: stock price too volatile
* Book values of equity: common shareholders equity
	* based on historical cost 
	* It is possible, but uncommon, for market value to be less than book value.
	* “Floor” or minimum value of the liquidation value per share 
	* Useful in bankruptcy
* Replacement value:
	* Liquidation value, value through liquidation of firm’s assets
	* Usually a measure for merger and acquisition
	* Tobin’s q is the ratio of market price to replacement cost
* Intrinsic value: the present value of all cash payments to the investor in the stock, discounted at the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate
	* Dividend Discount Models （DDM）
		* The growth rate in dividends （g） can be estimated in a number of ways
			* Using the company’s historical average growth rate
			* Using an industry median or average growth rate 
			* Using the sustainable growth rate.
				*  if a firm can generate return on investment （ROE） greater than its cost of capital, it will retain part or all earnings to sustain its growth
				* $$g=ROE\times b$$
	* Free Cash Flow Models （useful for firms without stable dividend payments）


### Price-Earning ratios and growth

* The value of the firm can be decomposed into two parts:
	* the value of the assets already in place, the no-growth value of the firm
	* Plus the NPV of its future investments, present value of growth opportunities
	* $$P_0=\frac{E_1}{k}+PVGO$$
	* $E_1$, earnings per share; k, required rate of return; PVGO, 未来预期增长机会现值
* The ratio of $PVGO/(E_1/k)$ is the ratio of firm value due to growth opportunities to value due to assets already in place
* Price-Earning ratio:
	* $$\color{red}{\frac{P_0}{E_1}=\frac{1}{k}(1+\frac{PVGO}{E/k})}$$
	* P/E rises dramatically with PVGO
	* High P/E indicates that the firm has ample growth opportunities.
	* 根据DDM, $P_0=\frac{D_1}{r-g}$, 则
		* $$\frac{P_0}{E_1}=\frac{D_1/EPS}{k-g}=\frac{1-b}{k-ROE\times b}$$
	* 当ROE、b增大时P-E增大
	* 当风险变大时，k增加，P-E减小

## 记

这门投资学的课程内容含量确实不算高，金融课之间的许多知识点也是相通的，可以互相参考借鉴着学习并复习。
